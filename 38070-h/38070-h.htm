<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>These Norwegian tales of elemental mountain,
forest and sea spirits, handed down by hinds and
huntsmen, woodchoppers and fisherfolk, men who led
a hard and lonely life amid primitive surroundings
are, perhaps, among the most fascinating the Scandinavian
countries have to offer. Nor are they only
meant to delight the child, though this they cannot
fail to do. &ldquo;Grown-ups&rdquo; also, who take pleasure in
a good story, well told, will enjoy the original &ldquo;Peer
Gynt&rdquo; legend, as it existed before Ibsen gave it more
symbolic meanings; and that glowing, beautiful picture
of an Avalon of the Northern seas shown in
&ldquo;The Island of Udröst.&rdquo; What could be more human
and moving than the tragic &ldquo;The Player on the
Jew&rsquo;s-Harp,&rdquo; or more genuinely entertaining than
&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Hares&rdquo;? &ldquo;The Master-Girl&rdquo; is a
Candida of fairy-land, and the thrill and glamor of
black magic and mystery run through such stories as
&ldquo;The Secret Church,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Comrade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lucky
Andrew.&rdquo; In &ldquo;The Honest Four-Shilling Piece&rdquo; we
have the adventures of a Norse Dick Whittington.
&ldquo;Storm Magic&rdquo; is one of the most thrilling sea tales,
bar none, ever written, and every story included in
the volume seems to bring with it the breath of the
Norse mountains or the tang of the spindrift on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Northern seas. Much of the charm of the stories
lies in the directness and simplicity of their telling;
and this quality, which adds so much to their appeal,
the translator has endeavored to preserve in its integrity.
He cannot but feel that &ldquo;The Norwegian
Fairy Book&rdquo; has an appeal for one and all, since it
is a book in which the mirror of fairy-tale reflects
human yearnings and aspirations, human loves, ambitions
and disillusionments, in an imaginatively
glamored, yet not distorted form. It is his hope and
belief that those who may come to know it will derive
as much pleasure from its reading as it gave
him to put it into English.</p>

<h1>THE NORWEGIAN FAIRY<br />
BOOK</h1>


<h2>I<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">PER GYNT</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the old days there lived in Kvam a marksman
by the name of Per Gynt. He was continually in
the mountains, where he shot bear and elk, for at
that time there were more forests on the Fjäll, and
all sorts of beasts dwelt in them. Once, late in the
fall, when the cattle had long since been driven down
from the mountain pastures, Per Gynt decided to
go up on the Fjäll again. With the exception of
three dairy-maids, all the herd-folk had already left
the mountains. But when Per Gynt reached Hövringalm,
where he intended to stay over-night in a
herdsman&rsquo;s hut, it already was so dark that he could
not see his hand before his eyes. Then the dogs
began to bark so violently that he felt quite uneasy.
And suddenly his foot struck something, and when
he took hold of it, it was cold, and large and slippery.
Since he felt certain he had not left the path,
he could not imagine what it might be; but he sensed
that all was not in order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; asked Per Gynt, for he
noticed that it moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I am the crooked one,&rdquo; was the answer. And
now Per Gynt knew as much as he had before. So
he went along its length, &ldquo;for sooner or later I will
come to the end of it,&rdquo; thought he.</p>

<p>As he went along he again struck against something,
and when he felt it, it was again something
cold, and large and slippery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; asked Per Gynt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the crooked one,&rdquo; was again the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whether you be crooked or straight, you
will have to let me pass,&rdquo; said Per Gynt; for he
noticed that he was going around in a circle, and
that the crooked one had coiled himself about the
herdsman&rsquo;s cottage. At these words the crooked
one moved a little to one side, so that Per Gynt could
get into the cottage. When he entered he found it
as dark inside as it was out; and he stumbled and
felt his way along the walls; for he wanted to lay
aside his firelock and his hunting-bag. But while he
was feeling his way about, he once more noticed
the something large, and cold and slippery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you now?&rdquo; cried Per Gynt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I am the big crooked one,&rdquo; was the answer.
And no matter where he took hold or where he set his
foot, he could feel the coils of the crooked one laid
around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a poor place to be in,&rdquo; thought Per Gynt,
&ldquo;for this crooked one is outside and inside; but I
will soon put what is wrong to rights.&rdquo; He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his firelock, went out again, and felt his way along
the crooked one until he came to his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you really and truly?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I am the big crooked one of Etnedal,&rdquo; said
the monster troll. Then Per Gynt did not waste
any time, but shot three bullets right through the
middle of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot again!&rdquo; cried the crooked one. But Per
Gynt knew better, for had he shot another time, the
bullet would have rebounded and hit him. When
this had been done, Per Gynt and his dogs took hold
of the great troll, and dragged him out of the hut,
so that they might make themselves comfortable
there. And meanwhile the hills about rang with
laughter and jeers. &ldquo;Per Gynt pulled hard, but the
dogs pulled harder!&rdquo; rang in his ears.</p>

<p>In the morning Per Gynt went out hunting.
When he had made his way far into the Fjäll, he
saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a mountain-top.
But when he reached the top of the mountain,
the girl had vanished, as well as her flock, and
all he saw was a great pack of bears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never yet have I seen bears run together in
packs,&rdquo; thought Per Gynt. But when he came
nearer, they all disappeared save one alone. Then
a voice called from a nearby hill:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Guard your boar, for understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Per Gynt is without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his firelock in his hand!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<p>&ldquo;O, then it is the worse for Per Gynt; but not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
my boar, because Per Gynt did not wash to-day,&rdquo;
sounded back from the hill. But Per Gynt spat on
his hands, and washed them thus, and then shot the
bear.</p>

<p>The hills rang with echoing laughter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have guarded your boar better,&rdquo;
called one voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think he carried the wash-bowl in his
mouth,&rdquo; answered the other.</p>

<p>Per Gynt skinned the bear, and buried his body
among the bowlders; but the head and skin he took
with him. On the way back he met a mountain
fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, my little lamb, how fat you are!&rdquo; rang out
from one hill. &ldquo;Just see how high Per Gynt carries
his firelock!&rdquo; sounded from another, as Per Gynt
shouldered his firelock and shot the fox. Him he
also skinned, and took the skin with him, and when
he reached the herdsman&rsquo;s hut, he nailed the heads,
with jaws wide open, against the outer wall. Then
he made a fire and hung a soup kettle over it; but it
smoked so terribly he could hardly keep his eyes
open, and therefore had to make a loop-hole. Suddenly
up came a troll, and thrust his nose through
the loop-hole; but his nose was so long that it reached
the fireplace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is my smeller, so take a good look!&rdquo; said
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a taste of the soup that I cook!&rdquo; said
Per Gynt, and he poured the whole kettleful of soup
over his nose. The troll rushed off lamenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
loudly; but from all the heights around came laughter
and derision and calls of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyri Soupsmeller, Gyri Soupsmeller!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon all was quiet for a time; yet before
very long the noise and tumult outside began again.
Per Gynt looked out, and saw a wagon drawn by
bears, the great troll was loaded upon it, and off
they went with him up the Fjäll. Suddenly a pail
of water was poured down through the chimney,
smothering the fire, and Per Gynt sat in the dark.
Then laughter and jibes came from every corner,
and one voice said: &ldquo;Now Per Gynt will be no
better off than the dairy-maids in the hut at Val!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Per Gynt once more lit the fire, called his dogs,
locked the herdsman&rsquo;s hut, and went on North,
toward the hut at Val, in which there were three
dairy-maids. After he had covered some distance
he saw a fire, as though the whole hut were ablaze,
and at the same moment he came across a whole pack
of wolves, of whom he shot some and clubbed the
others to death. When he reached the hut at Val,
he found it pitch dark there, and there was no fire
to be seen, far or near. But there were four strangers
in the hut, who were frightening the dairy-maids.
They were four mountain trolls, and their names
were: Gust i Väre, Tron Valfjeldet, Kjöstöl Aabakken,
and Rolf Eldförkungen. Gust i Väre stood at
the door, on guard, and Per Gynt shot at him, but
missed, so he ran away. When Per Gynt entered
the room the dairy-maids were well-nigh frightened
to death; but when the trolls saw who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
come they began to wail, and told Eldförkungen to
make a fire. At the same moment the dogs sprang
upon Kjöstöl Aabakken, and threw him head over
heels into the hearth, so that the ashes and sparks
flew about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen my snakes, Per Gynt?&rdquo; asked
Tron Valfjeldet&mdash;for that was what he called the
wolves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and now you shall travel the same road
your snakes have gone!&rdquo; cried Per Gynt, and shot
him. Then he made an end of Aabakken with the
butt-end of his firelock; but Eldförkungen had fled
through the chimney. After Per Gynt had done
this, he accompanied the dairy-maids back to their
village, for they did not venture to stay in the hut
any longer.</p>

<p>When Christmas came, Per Gynt once more got
under way. He had heard of a farmstead at Dovre,
where so many trolls were accustomed to congregate
on Christmas Eve, that the people who lived there
had to flee, and find places to stay at other farms.
This farmstead Per Gynt decided to hunt up; for he
thought he would like to see these trolls. He put on
torn clothing, and took with him a tame bear which
belonged to him, together with an awl, some pitch
and some wire. When he had reached the farmstead,
he went into the house and asked for shelter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God aid us!&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;We cannot
shelter you, and have to leave the house ourselves,
because the place is alive with trolls every Christmas
Eve!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>But Per Gynt thought he could manage to clear
the house of the trolls. So they told him to stay,
and gave him a pig&rsquo;s skin into the bargain. Then
the bear lay down behind the hearth, Per took out
his awl, his pitch and his wire, and set out to make
a single large shoe out of the pig&rsquo;s skin. And he
drew a thick rope through it for a lace, so that he
could lace the whole shoe together, and besides he
had two wagon-spokes for wedges at hand. Suddenly
the trolls came along with fiddles and fiddlers,
and some of them danced, and others ate of the
Christmas dinner that stood on the table, and some
fried bacon, and others fried frogs and toads and
disgusting things of that kind&mdash;the Christmas dinner
they had brought along themselves. In the
meantime some of them noticed the shoe Per Gynt
had made. Since it was evidently intended for a
large foot, all the trolls wanted to try it on. When
every one of them had thrust in his foot, Per Gynt
laced it, forced in a wedge, and then drew the lace
so taut that every last one of them was caught and
held in the shoe. But now the bear thrust forth his
nose, and sniffed the roast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to have some cake, little white
cat?&rdquo; said one of the trolls, and threw a burning
hot, roasted frog into the bear&rsquo;s jaws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thump them, Master Bruin!&rdquo; cried Per Gynt.
And the bear grew so angry that he rushed on the
trolls, raining blows on every side and scratching
them. And Per Gynt hewed into the crowd with
his other wagon-spoke as though he meant to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
their skulls. Then the trolls had to make themselves
scarce, but Per Gynt remained, and feasted
on the Christmas fare all of Christmas week, while
for many a long year no more was heard of the
trolls.</p>

<h2>II<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE ISLE OF UDRÖST</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there lived at Vaerö, not far
from Röst, a poor fisherman, named Isaac.
He had nothing but a boat and a couple of goats,
which his wife fed as well as she could with fish leavings,
and with the grass she was able to gather on
the surrounding hills; but his whole hut was full of
hungry children. Yet he was always satisfied with
what God sent him. The only thing that worried
him was his inability to live at peace with his neighbor.
The latter was a rich man, thought himself
entitled to far more than such a beggarly fellow as
Isaac, and wanted to get him out of the way, in
order to take for himself the anchorage before
Isaac&rsquo;s hut.</p>

<p>One day Isaac had put out a few miles to sea to
fish, when suddenly a dark fog fell, and in a flash
such a tremendous storm broke, that he had to throw
all his fish overboard in order to lighten ship and
save his life. Even then it was very hard to keep
the boat afloat; but he steered a careful course between
and across the mountainous waves, which
seemed ready to swallow him from moment to moment.
After he had kept on for five or six hours
in this manner, he thought that he ought to touch
land somewhere. But time went by, and the storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and fog grew worse and worse. Then he began to
realize that either he was steering out to sea, or
that the wind had veered, and at last he made sure
the latter was the case; for he sailed on and on
without a sight of land. Suddenly he heard a hideous
cry from the stern of the boat, and felt certain
that it was the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">drang</i>, who was singing his death-song.
Then he prayed God to guard his wife and
children, for he thought his last hour had come.
As he sat there and prayed, he made out something
black; but when his boat drew nearer, he noticed
that it was only three cormorants, sitting on a piece
of drift-wood and&mdash;swish! he had passed them.
Thus he sailed for a long time, and grew so hungry,
so thirsty and so weary that he did not know
what to do; for the most part he sat with the rudder
in his hand and slept. But all of a sudden the boat
ran up on a beach and stopped. Then Isaac opened
his eyes. The sun broke through the fog, and shone
on a beautiful land. Its hills and mountains were
green to their very tops, fields and meadows lay
among their slopes, and he seemed to breathe a
fragrance of flowers and grass sweeter than any
he had ever known before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be praised, now I am safe, for this is Udröst!&rdquo;
said Isaac to himself. Directly ahead of him
lay a field of barley, with ears so large and heavy
that he had never seen their like, and through the
barley-field a narrow path led to a green turf-roofed
cottage of clay, that rose above the field, and on the
roof of the cottage grazed a white goat with gilded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
horns, and an udder as large as that of the largest
cow. Before the door sat a little man clad in blue,
puffing away at a little pipe. He had a beard so
long and so large that it hung far down upon his
breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Udröst, Isaac!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, father,&rdquo; said Isaac, &ldquo;and do
you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be that I do,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I suppose
you want to stay here overnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would suit me very well, father,&rdquo; was
Isaac&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is with my sons, for they cannot bear
the smell of a Christian,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;Did
you meet them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I only met three cormorants, who were sitting
on a piece of drift-wood and croaking,&rdquo; was
Isaac&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, those were my sons,&rdquo; said the man, and
emptied his pipe, &ldquo;and now come into the house,
for I think you must be hungry and thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that liberty, father,&rdquo; said Isaac.</p>

<p>When the man opened the door, everything within
was so beautiful that Isaac could not get over his
admiration. He had never seen anything like it.
The table was covered with the finest dishes, bowls of
cream, and salmon and game, and liver dumplings
with syrup, and cheese as well, and there were whole
piles of doughnuts, and there was mead, and everything
else that is good. Isaac ate and drank bravely,
and yet his plate was never empty; and no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
how much he drank, his glass was always full. The
man neither ate much nor said much; but suddenly
they heard a noise and clamor before the house,
and the man went out. After a time he returned
with his three sons, and Isaac trembled inwardly
when they came through the door; but their father
must have quieted them, for they were very friendly
and amiable, and told Isaac he must use his guest-right,
and sit down and drink with them; for Isaac
had risen to leave the table, saying he had satisfied
his hunger. But he gave in to them, and they drank
mead together, and became good friends. And they
said that Isaac must go fishing with them, so that
he would have something to take with him when he
went home.</p>

<p>The first time they put out a great storm was
raging. One of the sons sat at the rudder, the second
at the bow, and the third in the middle; and
Isaac had to work with the bailing-can until he
dripped perspiration. They sailed as though they
were mad. They never reefed a sail, and when the
boat was full of water, they danced on the crests of
the waves, and slid down them so that the water in
the stern spurted up like a fountain. After a time
the storm subsided, and they began to fish. And the
sea was so full of fish that they could not even
put out an anchor, since mountains of fish were piled
up beneath them. The sons of Udröst drew up one
fish after another. Isaac knew his business; but
he had taken along his own fishing-tackle, and as
soon as a fish bit he let go again, and at last he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
caught not a single one. When the boat was filled,
they sailed home again to Udröst, and the sons
cleaned the fish, and laid them on the stands. Meanwhile
Isaac had complained to their father of his
poor luck. The man promised that he should do
better next time, and gave him a couple of hooks;
and the next time they went out to fish, Isaac caught
just as many as the others, and when they reached
home, he was given three stands of fish as his share.</p>

<p>At length Isaac began to get homesick, and when
he was about to leave, the man made him a present
of a new fishing-boat, full of meal, and tackle and
other useful things. Isaac thanked him repeatedly,
and the man invited him to come back when the season
opened again, since he himself was going to take
a cargo to Bergen, in the second <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">stevne</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Isaac
could go along and sell his fish there himself. Isaac
was more than willing, and asked him what course
he should set when he again wanted to reach Udröst.
&ldquo;All you need do is to follow the cormorant when
he heads for the open sea, then you will be on the
right course,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Good luck on your
way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when Isaac got underway, and looked around,
there was no Udröst in sight; far and wide, all
around him, he saw no more than the ocean.</p>

<p>When the time came, Isaac sailed to join the man
of Udröst&rsquo;s fishing-craft. But such a craft he had
never seen before. It was two hails long, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
when the steersman, who was on look-out in the
stern, wanted to call out something to the rower, the
latter could not hear him. So they had stationed
another man in the middle of the ship, close by the
mast, who had to relay the steersman&rsquo;s call to the
rower, and even he had to shout as loudly as he
could in order to make himself heard.</p>

<p>Isaac&rsquo;s share was laid down in the forepart of the
boat; and he himself took down the fish from the
stands; yet he could not understand how it was that
the stands were continually filled with fresh fish,
no matter how many he took away, and when he
sailed away they were still as full as ever. When
he reached Bergen, he sold his fish, and got so much
money for them that he was able to buy a new
schooner, completely fitted out, and with a cargo to
boot, as the man of Udröst had advised him. Late
in the evening, when he was about to sail for home,
the man came aboard and told him never to forget
those who survived his neighbor, for his neighbor
himself had died; and then he wished Isaac all possible
success and good fortune for his schooner, in
advance. &ldquo;All is well, and all stands firm that
towers in the air,&rdquo; said he, and what he meant was
that there was one aboard whom none could see, but
who would support the mast on his back, if need be.</p>

<p>Since that time fortune was Isaac&rsquo;s friend. And
well he knew why this was so, and never forgot to
prepare something good for whoever held the winter
watch, when the schooner was drawn up on land in
the fall. And every Christmas night there was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
glow and shimmer of light, the sound of fiddles and
music, of laughter and merriment, and of dancing
on the deserted schooner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Island of Udröst&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Huldreeventyr</cite>, Part I, p.&nbsp;259,

which appears at the moment of extremest peril to the Norsemen
helplessly shipwrecked in the stormy sea. The Norsemen, whose
fields near the boisterous waves yield but a niggardly return, cannot
say too much regarding its lavish fruitfulness and its abiding
peace. Udröst is almost an Isle of the Blest, an Avalon, to the fisherfolk
whose lives are passed in want and constant danger.</p>

<h2>III<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE THREE LEMONS</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there were three brothers
who had lost their parents, and since the latter
had left their sons nothing upon which to live, they
had to wander out into the world, and seek their
fortune. The two older brothers prepared for the
journey as well as they were able; but the youngest,
whom they called &ldquo;Mike by the Stove,&rdquo; because he
was always sitting behind the stove whittling, they
did not want to take with them. So they set out at
early dawn; yet for all their hurrying Mike by the
Stove reached the king&rsquo;s court as soon as they did.
When they got there, they asked to be taken into the
king&rsquo;s service. Well, said the king, he really had
no work for them to do; but since they were so poor,
he would see that they were kept busy; there was
always something or other to do in such a big establishment:
they could drive nails into the wall, and
when they were through, they could pull them out
again. And when that was done, they could carry
wood and water into the kitchen. Mike by the Stove
was quickest at driving his nails into the wall, and
pulling them out again, and he had been quick, too,
about carrying his wood and water. Therefore his
brothers grew jealous, and said he had declared he
could obtain the most beautiful princess in twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
kingdoms for the king&mdash;for the king&rsquo;s wife had died
and he was a widower. When the king heard this,
he told Mike by the Stove he had better do as he
had said, else he would have him brought to the
block, and his head chopped off.</p>

<p>Mike by the Stove replied that he had neither said
nor thought anything of the kind; but that seeing
the king was so severe, he would try it. So he took
a knapsack full of food and set out. But he had
only pushed a little way into the wood before he
grew hungry, and thought he would sample the provisions
they had given him at the king&rsquo;s castle.
When he had sat down in all peace and comfort
under a pine-tree by the side of the road, <a href="#frontispiece">an old
woman came limping along, and asked him what he
had in his knapsack</a>. &ldquo;Meat and bacon, granny,&rdquo;
said the youth. &ldquo;If you are hungry, come and share
with me!&rdquo; She thanked him, satisfied her hunger,
and then telling him she would do him a favor in
turn, limped off into the wood. When Mike by
the Stove had eaten his fill, he slung his knapsack
across his shoulder once more, and went his way;
but he had only gone a short distance before he
found a whistle. That would be fine, thought he,
to have a whistle, and be able to whistle himself a
tune while he traveled, and before long he really
succeeded in making it sound. That very moment
the wood was alive with dwarfs, all of them asking
with one voice: &ldquo;What are my lord&rsquo;s commands?
What are my lord&rsquo;s commands?&rdquo; Mike by the
Stove said he did not know he was their lord; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
if he had any command to give, he would ask them
to bring him the fairest princess in twelve kingdoms.
That would be easy enough, said the dwarfs;
they knew exactly who she was, and they could show
him the way; then he himself could go and fetch her,
since the dwarfs were powerless to touch her. They
showed him the way, and he reached his goal quickly
and without trouble, for no one interfered with him.
It was a troll&rsquo;s castle, and in it were three beautiful
princesses; but when Mike by the Stove stepped in,
they acted as though they had lost their wits, ran
around like frightened lambs, and finally turned
into three lemons that lay on the window-ledge.
Mike by the Stove was in despair, and very unhappy
because he did not know what to do. But after he
had reflected a while, he took the three lemons, and
put them in his pocket; because, thought he, he might
be glad he had done so should he grow thirsty during
his journey, for he had heard that lemons were sour.</p>

<p>After he had traveled a way, he grew very warm
and thirsty. There was no water to be found, and
he did not know how he was to refresh himself.
Then the lemons occurred to him, and he took one
and bit into it. But in it sat a princess, visible up
to her arms, and cried: &ldquo;Water, water!&rdquo; If she
could not have some water, said she, she must die.
The youth ran about everywhere like mad, looking
for water; but there was no water there, and none
to be found, and when he returned she was dead.</p>

<p>After he had gone on again a while, he grew still
more thirsty, and since he found nothing with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to refresh himself, he took another lemon and bit
into it. And another princess looked out, up to her
shoulders, and she was even more beautiful than the
first. She cried for water, and said that if she
could not have some water she must die on the spot.
Mike by the Stove ran about and looked under stones
and moss; but he found no water, so this princess
also died.</p>

<p>Mike by the Stove thought that things were going
from bad to worse, and this was the truth, since the
further he went the warmer it grew. The part of the
country in which he was traveling was so parched
and dried that not a drop of water was to be found,
and he was half-dead with thirst. For a long time
he hesitated before biting into the last lemon; but
at last there was nothing else left to do. When he
had bitten into it, a princess looked out: she was the
most beautiful in twelve kingdoms, and she cried
that if she could have no water, she must die on the
spot. Mike by the Stove ran about and looked for
water, and this time he met the king&rsquo;s miller, who
showed him the way to the mill-pond. When he had
come with her to the mill-pond, and had given her
water, she came completely out of the lemon. But
she had nothing to wear, and Mike by the Stove had
to give her his smock. She put it on, and hid in a
tree; while he was to go to the castle and bring her
clothes, and tell the king he had found her, and how
it had all happened.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cook had come down to the pond
to fetch water. When she saw the lovely face that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was reflected in the pond, she thought it was her
own, and was so pleased that she began to dance and
jump around, because she had grown so beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the devil fetch the water, I&rsquo;m far too handsome
to bother with it!&rdquo; said she, and threw away
the water-pail. And then she suddenly noticed that
the face in the water was that of the princess who
sat in the tree. This made her so angry that she
pulled her down from the tree, and threw her into
the pond. Then she herself put on Mike by the
Stove&rsquo;s smock, and climbed into the tree. When the
king arrived, and saw the swart, homely kitchen-maid,
he grew red and white in turn; but when he
heard the people say she was the greatest beauty in
twelve kingdoms, he had to believe, willy-nilly, that
there was something in it, and he did not want to be
unjust to Mike by the Stove, who had taken so much
trouble to find her. She might grow more beautiful
in time, thought he, if she were adorned with jewels,
and dressed in fine clothes, and so he took her home
with him. Then they sent for wig-makers and seamstresses,
and she was adorned and dressed like a
princess; but for all their washing and bedizening,
she remained swart and homely. After a while,
when the kitchen-maid had to go to the pond to fetch
water, she caught a great silver fish in her pail. She
carried it up and showed it to the king, who thought
it was a beauty; but the homely princess declared
it to be the work of witches, and that they were to
burn it, for she had noticed at once what it was. So
the following morning the fish was burned, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
found a lump of silver in the ashes. Then the cook
went up and told the king, and he thought it very
strange; but the princess said it was witchcraft pure
and simple, and that they were to bury the silver
under the manure-pile. The king did not want to,
but she gave him no peace until he consented, and
finally said they were to do so. But on the following
day a beautiful linden-tree stood where they had
buried the lump of silver, and the leaves of the linden-tree
glistened like silver, too. When they told
the king he thought it remarkable; but the princess
said it was no more nor less than witchcraft, and
that the linden-tree must be cut down. This the king
did not wish done at all; but the princess tormented
him so that finally he yielded in this as well. When
the maids went out and brought wood for the fire
from the linden-tree, it was pure silver. &ldquo;We need
not tell the king and the princess anything about it,&rdquo;
said one of them, &ldquo;for they would only burn it up and
melt it down. Let us keep it in the wardrobe instead.
It might be very useful to us some day, if some
one comes along, and we want to marry.&rdquo; They
were all of the same mind, but when they had carried
the wood a while, it grew terribly heavy. And
when they looked to see why this was, the sticks of
wood had turned into a little child, and before long
she had become the most beautiful princess imaginable.
The maids saw that there was some hocus-pocus
about it, gave her clothes, ran off to fetch the
youth who had been sent to find the most beautiful
princess in twelve kingdoms, and told him their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
story. And when Mike by the Stove arrived, the
princess explained to him how everything had happened,
that the cook had thrown her into the pond,
and that she had been the silver fish, the lump of
silver, and the linden-tree, and the sticks of wood,
and that she was the true princess. It was hard to
get at the king, for the swart, homely cook was with
him early and late; but at last they decided to tell
him that a declaration of war had come from a
neighboring monarch, and so they got him out.
When he saw the beautiful princess, he fell so deeply
in love with her that he wanted to marry her out of
hand, and when he heard how badly the swart,
homely cook had treated her, the latter was promptly
punished. Then they held a wedding that was heard
of and talked about in twelve kingdoms.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">THE NEIGHBOR UNDERGROUND</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a peasant who lived
in Telemarken, and had a big farm; yet he had
nothing but bad luck with his cattle, and at last lost
his house and holding. He had scarcely anything
left, and with the little he had, he bought a bit of
land that lay off to one side, far away from the city,
in the wildwood and the wilderness. One day, as
he was passing through his farm-yard, he met a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, neighbor!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;I thought I was
all alone here. Are you a neighbor of mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can see my homestead over yonder,&rdquo; said
the man. &ldquo;It is not far from your own.&rdquo; And
there lay a farm-holding such as he had never before
seen, handsome and prosperous, and in fine condition.
Then he knew very well that this must be one
of the underground people; yet he had no fear, but
invited his neighbor in to drink a glass with him,
and the neighbor seemed to enjoy it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the neighbor, &ldquo;there is one thing
you must do for me as a favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First let me know what it is,&rdquo; said the peasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must shift your cow-stable, because it is in
my way,&rdquo; was the answer he gave the peasant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not do that,&rdquo; said the peasant. &ldquo;I put
it up only this summer, and the winter is coming on.
What am I to do with my cattle then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you choose; but if you do not tear it
down, you will live to regret it,&rdquo; said his neighbor.
And with that he went his way.</p>

<p>The peasant was surprised at this, and did not
know what to do. It seemed quite foolish to him
to start in to tear down his stable when the long
winter night was approaching, and besides, he could
not count on help.</p>

<p>One day as he was standing in his stable, he sank
through the ground. Down below, in the place to
which he had come, everything was unspeakably
handsome. There was nothing which was not of
gold or of silver. Then the man who had called
himself his neighbor came along, and bade him sit
down. After a time food was brought in on a silver
platter, and mead in a silver jug, and the neighbor
invited him to draw up to the table and eat. The
peasant did not dare refuse, and sat down at the
table; but just as he was about to dip his spoon into
the dish, something fell down into his food from
above, so that he lost his appetite. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;now you can see why we don&rsquo;t like your
stable. We can never eat in peace, for as soon as we
sit down to a meal, dirt and straw fall down, and no
matter how hungry we may be, we lose our appetites
and cannot eat. But if you will do me the favor to set
up your stable elsewhere, you shall never go short
of pasture nor good crops, no matter how old you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
may grow to be. But if you won&rsquo;t, you shall know
naught but lean years all your life long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the peasant heard that, he went right to
work pulling down his stable, to put it up again in another
place. Yet he could not have worked alone, for
at night, when all slept, the building of the new stable
went forward just as it did by day, and well he knew
his neighbor was helping him.</p>

<p>Nor did he regret it later, for he had enough of
feed and corn, and his cattle waxed fat. Once there
was a year of scarcity, and feed was so short that he
was thinking of selling or slaughtering half his herd.
But one morning, when the milk-maid went into the
stable, the dog was gone, and with him all the cows
and the calves. She began to cry and told the peasant.
But he thought to himself, that it was probably
his neighbor&rsquo;s doings, who had taken the cattle to
pasture. And sure enough, so it was; for toward
spring, when the woods grew green, he saw the dog
come along, barking and leaping, by the edge of the
forest, and after him followed all the cows and
calves, and the whole herd was so fat it was a pleasure
to look at it.</p>

<h2>V<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE SECRET CHURCH</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> the schoolmaster of Etnedal was staying
in the mountains to fish. He was very fond
of reading, and so he always carried one book or
another along with him, with which he could lie
down, and which he read on holidays, or when the
weather forced him to stay in the little fishing-hut.
One Sunday morning, as he was lying there reading,
it seemed as though he could hear church bells;
sometimes they sounded faintly, as though from a
great distance; at other times the sound was clear,
as though carried by the wind. He listened long
and with surprise; and did not trust his ears&mdash;for
he knew that it was impossible to hear the bells of
the parish church so far out among the hills&mdash;yet
suddenly they sounded quite clearly on his ear. So
he laid aside his book, stood up and went out. The
sun was shining, the weather was fine, and one group
of churchgoers after another passed him in their
Sunday clothes, their hymn-books in their hands.
A little further on in the forest, where he had never
before seen anything but trees and brush, stood an
old wooden church. After a time the priest came
by, and he was so old and decrepit that his wife and
daughter led him. And when they came to the spot
where the schoolmaster was standing, they stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and invited him to come to church and hear mass.
The schoolmaster thought for a moment; but since
it occurred to him that it might be amusing to see
how these people worshiped God, he said he would
go along, if he did not thereby suffer harm. No,
no harm should come to him, said they, but rather a
blessing. In the church all went forward in a quiet
and orderly manner, there were neither dogs nor
crying children to disturb the service, and the singing
was good&mdash;but he could not make out the words.
When the priest had been led to the pulpit he delivered
what seemed to the listening schoolmaster
a really fine and edifying sermon&mdash;but one, it appeared
to him, of quite a peculiar trend of thought,
which he was not always able to follow. Nor did the
&ldquo;Our Father in heaven ...&rdquo; sound just right, and
the &ldquo;Deliver us from evil ...&rdquo; he did not hear at
all. Nor was the name of Jesus uttered; and at the
close no blessing was spoken.</p>

<p>When mass had been said, the schoolmaster was
invited to the parsonage. He gave the same answer
he had already returned, that he would be glad to
go if he suffered no harm thereby. And as before,
they assured him he would not lose; but rather gain
thereby. So he went with them to the parsonage,
just such an attractive and well-built parsonage like
most in the neighborhood. It had a garden with
flowers and apple-trees, with a neat lattice fence
around it. They invited him to dinner, and the
dinner was well cooked and carefully prepared. As
before, he said that he would gladly accept their invitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
if he came to no harm thereby, and was
given the same reply. So he ate with them, and said
later that he had noticed no difference between this
food and the Christian dinner he had received when,
once or twice, he had been asked to dinner by the
priest of the village church. When he had drunk
his coffee, the wife and daughter drew him aside
into another room, and the wife complained that her
husband had grown so old and decrepit that he could
not keep up much longer. Then she began to say
that the schoolmaster was such a strong and able
man, and finally, that she and her daughter would
like to have him for priest, and whether he would
not stay and succeed the old father. The schoolmaster
objected that he was no scholar. But they
insisted that he had more learning than was needed
in their case, for they never had any visits from the
bishop, nor did the dean ever hold a chapter, for of
all such things they knew nothing. When the
schoolmaster heard that, he said that even though he
had the necessary scholarship, he doubted very much
that he had the right vocation, and since this was a
most important matter for him and for them, it
would be unwise to act too hurriedly, so he would
ask for a year to think it over. When he had said
that, he found himself standing by a pond in the
wood, and could see neither church nor parsonage.
So he thought the matter was at an end. But a year
later, just as the term he had set was up, he was
working on a house, for during the school vacation
he busied himself either with fishing or carpentering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
He was just straddling a wall when he saw
the pastor&rsquo;s daughter, the one whom he had seen
in the mountains, coming straight toward him. She
asked him if he had thought over the matter.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have thought it over, but I cannot;
since I cannot answer for it before God and
my own conscience.&rdquo; That very moment the pastor&rsquo;s
daughter from underground vanished; but immediately
after he cut himself in the knee with the
ax in such wise that he remained a cripple for life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Secret Church&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Huldreeventyr</cite>, I, 217, from
Valders, told by a pastor), impresses one with its weirdness, in contrast
to the preceding tale of friendly neighborly understanding
with the underground folk. In Norway stories are still told of these
churches in the wilderness, and of the chiming of their bells, which
are supposed to be of evil omen to those who hear them. The idea
of the church of ice, in Ibsen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brand,&rdquo; may have its root in such
folk-tale.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE COMRADE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a peasant boy, who
dreamed that he would get a princess, from
far, far away, and that she was as white as milk,
and as red as blood, and so rich that her riches had
no end. When he woke, it seemed to him as though
she were still standing before him, and she was so
beautiful and winning that he could not go on living
without her. So he sold all that he had, and went
forth to look for her. He wandered far, and at last,
in the winter-time, came into a land where the roads
all ran in straight lines, and made no turns. After
he had wandered straight ahead for full three
months, he came to a city. And there a great block
of ice lay before the church door, and in the middle
of it was a corpse, and the whole congregation spat
at it as the people passed by. This surprised the
youth, and when the pastor came out of the church,
he asked him what it meant. &ldquo;He was a great evil-doer,&rdquo;
replied the pastor, &ldquo;who has been executed
because of his misdeeds, and has been exposed here
in shame and derision.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what did he do?&rdquo;
asked the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During his mortal life he was a wine-dealer,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
answered the pastor, &ldquo;and he watered the wine he
sold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This did not strike the youth as being such a terrible
crime. &ldquo;Even if he had to pay for it with his
life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one might now grant him a Christian
burial, and let him rest in peace.&rdquo; But the pastor
said that this could not be done at all; for people
would be needed to break him out of the ice; and
money would be needed to buy a grave for him from
the church; and the gravedigger would want to be
paid for his trouble; and the sexton for tolling the
bells; and the cantor for singing; and the pastor
himself for the funeral sermon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think there is any one who would pay all
that money for such an arrant sinner&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; inquired
the pastor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the youth. If he could manage to have
him buried, he would be willing to pay for the wake
out of his own slender purse.</p>

<p>At first the pastor would hear nothing of it; but
when the youth returned with two men, and asked
him in their presence whether he refused the dead
man Christian burial, he ventured no further objections.</p>

<p>So they released the wine-dealer from his block of
ice, and laid him in consecrated ground. The bells
tolled, and there was singing, and the pastor threw
earth on the coffin, and they had a wake at which
tears and laughter alternated. But when the youth
had paid for the wake, he had but a few shillings left
in his pocket. Then he once more set out on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
way; but had not gone far before a man came up
behind him, and asked him whether he did not find it
tiresome to wander along all alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the youth, he always had something
to think about. The man asked whether he did not
need a servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;I am used to serving myself,
so I have no need of a servant; and no matter
how much I might wish for one, I still would have
to do without, since I have no money for his keep
and pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you need a servant, as I know better than
you do,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and you need one upon
whom you can rely in life and death. But if you do
not want me for a servant, then let me be your comrade.
I promise that you will not lose thereby, and
I will not cost you a shilling. I travel at my own
expense, nor need you be put to trouble as regards
my food and clothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the youth was glad to
have him for a comrade, and they resumed their
journey, the man as a rule going in advance and
pointing out the way.</p>

<p>After they had wandered long through various
lands, over hills and over heaths, they suddenly
stood before a wall of rock. The comrade knocked,
and begged to be let in. Then the rock opened before
them, and after they had gone quite a way into
the interior of the hill, a witch came to meet them and
offered them a chair. &ldquo;Be so good as to sit down,
for you must be weary!&rdquo; said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down yourself!&rdquo; answered the man. Then
she had to sit down and remain seated, for the chair
had power to hold fast all that approached it. In
the meantime they wandered about in the hill, and
the comrade kept looking around until he saw a
sword that hung above the door. This he wanted to
have, and he promised the witch that he would
release her from her chair if she would let him have
the sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;ask what you will. You can
have anything else, but not that, for that is my
Three-Sisters Sword!&rdquo; (There were three sisters
to whom the sword belonged in common.) &ldquo;Then
you may sit where you are till the world&rsquo;s end!&rdquo;
said the man. And when she heard that she promised
to let him have the sword, if he would release
her.</p>

<p>So he took the sword, and went away with it; but
he left her sitting there, after all. When they had
wandered far, over stony wastes and desolate heaths,
they again came to a wall of rock. There the comrade
again knocked, and begged to be let in. Just
as before, the rock opened, and when they had gone
far into the hill, a witch came to meet them with a
chair and bade them be seated, &ldquo;for you must be
tired,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down yourself!&rdquo; said the comrade. And
what had happened to her sister happened to her, she
had to seat herself, and could not get up again. In
the meantime the youth and his comrade went about
in the hill, and the latter opened all the closets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
drawers, until he found what he had been searching
for, a ball of golden twine. This he wished to have,
and promised he would release her from the chair if
she would give it to him. She told him he might
have all she possessed; but that she could not give
him the ball, since it was her Three-Sisters Ball.
But when she heard that she would have to sit in the
chair till the Day of Judgment, she changed her
mind. Then the comrade took the ball, and in spite
of it left her sitting where she was. Then they wandered
for many a day through wood and heath, until
they came to a wall of rock. All happened as it had
twice before, the comrade knocked, the hill opened,
and inside a witch came to meet them with a chair,
and bade them sit down. The two had gone through
many rooms before the comrade spied an old hat
hanging on a hook behind the door. The hat he
must have, but the old witch would not part with
it, since it was her Three-Sisters Hat, and if she gave
it away she would be thoroughly unhappy. But
when she heard that she would have to sit there until
the Day of Judgment if she did not give up the hat,
she at last agreed to do so. The comrade took the
hat, and then told her to keep on sitting where she
sat, like her sisters.</p>

<p>At length they came to a river. There the comrade
took the ball of golden twine and flung it against
the hill on the other side of the river with such force
that it bounded back. And when it had flown back
and forth several times, there stood a bridge, and
when they had reached the other side, the comrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
told the youth to wind up the golden twine again as
swiftly as possible, &ldquo;for if we do not take it away
quickly, the three witches will cross and tear us to
pieces.&rdquo; The youth wound as quickly as he could,
and just as he was at the last thread, the witches
rushed up, hissing, flung themselves into the water
so that the foam splashed high, and snatched at the
end of the thread. But they could not grasp it, and
drowned in the river.</p>

<p>After they had again wandered on for a few days,
the comrade said: &ldquo;Now we will soon reach the
castle in which she lives, the princess of whom you
dreamed, and when we reach it, you must go to the
castle and tell the king what you dreamed, and your
journey&rsquo;s aim.&rdquo; When they got there, the youth
did as he was told, and was very well received. He
was given a room for himself, and one for his servant,
and when it was time to eat, he was invited to
the king&rsquo;s own table. When he saw the princess,
he recognized her at once as the vision of his dream.
He told her, too, why he was there, and she replied
that she liked him quite well, and would gladly take
him, but first he must undergo three tests. When
they had eaten, she gave him a pair of gold shears
and said: &ldquo;The first test is that you take these
shears and keep them, and give them back to me to-morrow
noon. That is not a very severe test,&rdquo; she
said, and smiled, &ldquo;but, if you cannot stand it, you
must die, as the law demands, and you will be in the
same case as the suitors whose bones you may see
lying without the castle gate.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no great feat,&rdquo; thought the youth to himself.
But the princess was so merry and active, and
so full of fun and nonsense, that he thought neither
of the shears nor of himself, and while they were
laughing and joking, she secretly robbed him of the
shears without his noticing it. When he came to his
room in the evening, and told what had occurred,
and what the princess had said to him, and about the
shears which she had given him to guard, his comrade
asked: &ldquo;And have you still the shears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth looked through all his pockets; but his
shears were not there, and he was more than unhappy
when he realized that he had lost them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, never mind. I will see whether I can
get them back for you,&rdquo; said his comrade, and went
down into the stable. There stood an enormous
goat which belonged to the princess, and could fly
through the air more swiftly than he could walk on
level ground. The comrade took the Three-Sisters
Sword, gave him a blow between the horns, and
asked: &ldquo;At what time does the princess ride to meet
her lover to-night?&rdquo; The goat bleated, and said he
did not dare tell; but when the comrade had given
him another thump, he did say that the princess
would come at eleven o&rsquo;clock sharp. Then the comrade
put on the Three-Sisters Hat, which made him
invisible, and waited for the princess. When she
came, she anointed the goat with a salve she carried
in a great horn, and cried out: &ldquo;Up, up! over
gable and roof, over land and sea, over hill and dale,
to my dearest, who waits for me in the hill!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>As the goat flew upward, the comrade swung himself
up in back, and then they were off like the wind
through the clouds: it was not a long journey. Suddenly
they stood before a wall of rock, she knocked,
and then they took their way into the interior of the
hill, to the troll who was her dearest. &ldquo;And now a
new suitor has come who wants to win me, sweetheart,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;He is young and handsome, but
I will have none but you,&rdquo; she went on, and made a
great time over the troll. &ldquo;I have set him a test,
and here are the shears that he was to keep and
guard. You shall keep them now!&rdquo; Then both of
them laughed as though the youth had already lost
his head. &ldquo;Yes, I will keep them, and take good
care of them, and a kiss from you shall pledge the
truth, when crows are cawing around the youth!&rdquo;
said the troll; and he laid the shears in an iron chest
with three locks. But at the moment he was dropping
the shears into the chest, the comrade caught
them up. None could see him, for he was wearing
the Three-Sisters Hat. So the troll carefully locked
the empty chest, and put the key into a hollow
double-tooth, where he kept other magic things.
&ldquo;The suitor could hardly find it there,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>After midnight the princess set out for home. The
comrade swung himself up in back again, and the
trip home did not take long.</p>

<p>The following noon the youth was invited to dine
at the king&rsquo;s table. But this time the princess kept
her nose in the air, and was so haughty and snappish
that she hardly condescended to glance in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
youth&rsquo;s direction. But after they had eaten, she
looked very solemn, and asked in the sweetest manner:
&ldquo;You probably still have the shears I gave you
to take care of yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, here they are,&rdquo; said the youth; and he flung
them on the table so that they rang. The princess
could not have been more frightened had he thrown
the shears in her face. But she tried to make the
best of a bad bargain, and said in a sweet voice:
&ldquo;Since you have taken such good care of the shears,
you will not find it hard to keep my ball of gold twine
for me. I should like to have it back by to-morrow
noon; but if you cannot give it to me then, you must
die, according to the law.&rdquo; The youth thought it
would not be so very hard, and put the ball of gold
twine in his pocket. Yet the princess once more
began to toy and joke with him, so that he thought
neither of himself nor of the ball of gold twine, and
while they were in the midst of their merry play she
stole the golden ball from him, and then dismissed
him.</p>

<p>When he came up into his room, and told what she
had said and done, his comrade asked: &ldquo;And have
you still the ball of gold twine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said the youth, and thrust his hand
into the pocket in which he had placed it. But there
was no ball in it, and he fell into such despair that
he did not know what to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not worry,&rdquo; said his comrade. &ldquo;I will see
whether I cannot get it back for you.&rdquo; He took his
sword and his hat, and went to a smith and had him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
weld twelve extra pounds of iron to his sword.
Then, when he entered the stable, he gave the goat
such a blow between the horns with it that he staggered,
and asked: &ldquo;At what time does the princess
ride to her dearest to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At twelve o&rsquo;clock sharp,&rdquo; said the goat.</p>

<p>The comrade once more put on his Three-Sisters
Hat, and waited until the princess came with the
horn of ointment and anointed the goat. Then she
repeated what she had already said: &ldquo;Up, up! over
gable and tower, over land and sea, over hill and
dale, to my dearest who waits for me in the hill!&rdquo;
And when the goat arose, the comrade swung himself
up in back, and off they were like lightning through
the air. Soon they had reached the troll-hill, and
when she had knocked thrice they passed through
the interior of the hill till they met the troll who
was her dearest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What manner of care did you take of the golden
shears I gave you yesterday, my friend?&rdquo; asked the
princess. &ldquo;The suitor had them, and he gave them
back to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was quite impossible, said the troll, for he
had locked them up in a chest with three locks, and
had thrust the key into his hollow tooth. But when
they had unlocked the chest and looked, there were
no shears there. Then the princess told him that
she had now given him her ball of golden twine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I took it away from him
again without his having noticed it; but what are
we to do if he is a master of such arts?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The troll could not think of anything to suggest;
but after they had reflected a while they hit on the
idea of lighting a great fire, and burning the ball of
gold twine, for then the suitor could surely not
regain it. Yet when she threw it into the flames,
the comrade leaped forward and caught it, without
being seen, for he was wearing the Three-Sisters
Hat. After the princess had stayed a little while
she returned home, and again the comrade sat up
behind, and the trip home was swiftly and safely
made. When the youth was asked to the king&rsquo;s
table, the comrade gave him the ball. The princess
was still more sharp and disdainful in her remarks
than before, and after they had eaten she pinched
her lips, and said: &ldquo;Would it not be possible for
me to get my ball of gold twine again, which I gave
you yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;you can have it; there
it is!&rdquo; and he flung it on the table with such a thud
that the king leaped up in the air with fright.</p>

<p>The princess grew as pale as a corpse; but she
made the best of a bad bargain, and said that he
had done well. Now there was only one more little
test for him to undergo. &ldquo;If you can bring me what
I am thinking about by to-morrow noon, then you
may have me and keep me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth felt as though he had been condemned
to death; for it seemed altogether impossible for
him to know of what the princess was thinking, and
still more impossible to bring her the thing in question.
And when he came to his room his comrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
could scarcely quiet him. He said he would take the
matter in hand, as he had done on the other occasions,
and at last the youth grew calmer, and lay
down to sleep. In the meantime the comrade went
to the smith, and had him weld an additional twenty-four
pounds of iron on his sword. When this had
been done, he went to the stable, and gave the goat
such a smashing blow between the horns that he
flew to the other side of the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what time does the princess ride to her dearest
to-night?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one o&rsquo;clock sharp,&rdquo; bleated the goat.</p>

<p>When the time came, the comrade was standing in
the stable, wearing his Three-Sisters Hat, and after
the princess had anointed the goat and spoken her
formula, off they went through the air as before,
with the comrade sitting in back. But this time he
was anything but gentle, and kept giving the princess
a cuff here, and a cuff there, until she had received
a terrible drubbing. When she reached the
wall of rock, she knocked three times, the hill opened,
and they flew through it to her dearest.</p>

<p>She complained bitterly to him, and said she would
never have thought it possible that the weather could
affect one so; it had seemed to her as though some
one were flying along with them, beating her and
the goat, and her whole body must be covered with
black and blue spots, so badly had she been thrashed.
And then she told how the suitor had again had the
ball of twine. How he had managed to get it, neither
she nor the troll could guess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you know the thought that came to me?&rdquo;
said she. Of course the troll did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have told him he is to bring
me the thing I am thinking of by to-morrow noon,
and that thing is your head. Do you think, dear
friend, that he will be able to bring it to me?&rdquo; and
she made a great time over the troll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think he can,&rdquo; said the troll, who felt
quite sure of himself, and laughed and chortled with
pleasure in the most malicious way. For he and the
princess were firmly convinced that the youth would
be more apt to lose his own head, and be left to the
ravens, than that he would be able to bring the princess
the head of the troll.</p>

<p>Toward morning the princess wanted to fly home
again, but she did not venture to ride alone; the troll
must accompany her. He was quite ready to do so,
took his goat from the stable&mdash;he had one just like
that of the princess&mdash;and anointed him between the
horns. When the troll had mounted, the comrade
swung up in back of him, and off they were through
the air in the direction of the king&rsquo;s castle. But on
the way the comrade beat away lustily at the troll
and his goat, and gave him thump after thump, and
blow after blow with his sword, until they were flying
lower and lower, and at last nearly fell into the sea
across which their journey led them. When the troll
noticed how stormy the weather was, he accompanied
the princess to the castle, and waited outside to make
sure that she really came home safely. But the
moment when the door closed on the princess, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
comrade hewed off his head, and went up with it to
the youth&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the thing of which the princess was
thinking,&rdquo; said he. Then everything was in apple-pie
order, and when the youth was invited to the
king&rsquo;s table and they had eaten, the princess grew
as merry as a lark. &ldquo;Have you, perhaps, the thing
of which I was thinking?&rdquo; &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the
youth, and he drew forth the head from beneath his
coat, and flung it on the table so that the table and
all that was on it fell over. The princess looked as
though she had come from the grave; yet she could
not deny that this was the thing of which she had
thought, and now she had to take the youth, as
she had promised. So the wedding was celebrated,
and there was great joy throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>But the comrade took the youth aside, and said
that on their wedding-night he might close his eyes
and pretend to sleep, but that, if he loved his life,
and followed his advice, he would not sleep a wink
until the princess was freed from her troll-skin. He
must whip it off with nine new switches of birch-wood,
and strip it off with three milk-baths beside;
first he must scrub it off in a tub of year-old whey,
then he must rub it off in a tub of sour milk, and
finally, he must sponge it off in a tub of sweet milk.
He had laid the birch switches beneath the bed, and
had stood the tubs of milk in the corner; all was prepared.
The youth promised to follow his advice, and
do as he had told him. When night came, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lay in his bed, the princess raised herself on her
elbows, to see if he were really asleep, and she tickled
him under the nose; but he was sleeping quite
soundly. Then she pulled his hair and his beard. But
it seemed to her that he slept like a log. Then she
drew a great butcher&rsquo;s knife out from beneath her
pillow, and wanted to cut off his head. But the
youth leaped up, struck the knife from her hand,
seized her by the hair, whipped her with the
switches, and did not stop until not one was left.
Thereupon he threw her into the tub of whey, and
then he saw what sort of creature she really was,
for her whole body was coal-black. But when he had
scrubbed her in the whey, and rubbed her in the sour
milk, and sponged her in the sweet milk, the troll-skin
had altogether disappeared, and she was lovelier
than she had ever been before.</p>

<p>On the following day the comrade said that now
they must get on their way. The youth was ready
to set forth, and the princess, too, for her dower had
long since been made ready. During the night the
comrade had brought all the gold and silver, and
all the valuables which the troll had left in the hill
to the castle, and when they wanted to start in the
morning, the castle court-yard was so full they could
scarcely get through. The dower supplied by the
troll was worth more than the king&rsquo;s whole country,
and they did not know how they were to take it
home. But the comrade found a way out of the
difficulty. The troll had also left six goats who
could fly through the air. These he loaded so heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with gold and silver that they had to walk on
the ground, and were not strong enough to rise into
the air; and what the goats could not carry, had to
be left at the castle. Thus they traveled for a long
time, but at last the goats grew so weary and
wretched that they could go no further. The youth
and the princess did not know what to do; but when
the comrade saw that they could not move from the
spot, he took the whole treasure on his back, topped
it with the goats, and carried it all until they were
no more than half a mile from the youth&rsquo;s home.
Then the comrade said: &ldquo;Now I must part from you,
for I can stay with you no longer.&rdquo; But the youth
would not hear of parting, and would not let him go
at any price.</p>

<p>So he went along another half mile, but further
than that he could not go, and when the youth
pressed him, and insisted that he come home with
him, and stay there; or that he at least celebrate
their home-coming, he merely said no, he could not
do so. Then the youth asked him what he wished in
the way of payment for his company and aid. &ldquo;If I
am to wish for something, then I would like to have
half of all that you may gain in the course of the
next five years,&rdquo; said his comrade. And this was
promised him.</p>

<p>Now when the comrade had gone, the youth hid
all his treasure, and went straight home. And there
they celebrated a home-coming feast that was talked
about in seven kingdoms; and when that was over
they spent the whole winter going back and forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with the goats, and his father&rsquo;s twelve horses, bringing
all the gold and silver home.</p>

<p>After five years the comrade came again and asked
for his share. Then the man divided all his possessions
into two equal parts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet there is one thing you have not divided,&rdquo;
said the comrade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could that be?&rdquo; asked the man. &ldquo;I
thought I had divided everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been blessed with a child,&rdquo; said the
comrade, &ldquo;and that you must also divide into two
equal parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, such was really the case. Then he took up
his sword, but when he raised it and was about to
divide the child, his comrade seized the point of the
sword so that he could not strike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not happy, since you need not strike?&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I never was happier,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is how happy I was when you delivered
me out of the block of ice,&rdquo; said the comrade.
&ldquo;Keep all you have: I need nothing, for I am a
disembodied spirit.&rdquo; And he told him he was the
wine-dealer who had lain in the block of ice before
the church door, spat upon by all; and that he had
become his comrade, and had aided him, because the
youth had sacrificed all he had in order that he
might have peace, and a burial in consecrated
ground. He had been permitted to accompany him
for the space of a year, and the time had run out
when he had first parted with him. Now he had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
more been allowed to visit him; yet on this occasion
he would have to part for all time, for the bells of
heaven were calling him.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ASPENCLOG</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Aspenclog&rsquo;s</span> mother was an aspen-tree. He
slew the man who had chopped her down.
Then he went to the king and asked whether he could
give him work. He wanted no other pay than the
right to give the king three good thumps on the back
when there was no more work for him to do. The
king agreed to this condition, for he thought he
would always have enough work for him to do.
Then he sent him to the forest to gather wood. But
Aspenclog piled up such a tremendous load that two
horses could not pull the wagon. So he took two
polar bears, harnessed them to the wagon, drove
it home, and left the bears in the stable, where they
ate up all the king&rsquo;s cattle.</p>

<p>Then he was told to keep a mill grinding which
the evil one often brought to a stop. No sooner
had Aspenclog commenced to grind than, sure
enough, the mill stopped. Aspenclog took a candle
and made a search. No doubt of it, the evil one had
wedged his leg between the mill-stones. No sooner
had Aspenclog seen the leg, than he chopped it off
with his club. Then the evil one came hobbling up
on one leg, and begged fearfully and tearfully for
the leg he had lost. No, he could not have it, said
the youth, unless he gave him a bushel of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for it. But when the evil one had to pay Aspenclog
the money, he thought to cheat him, and said that
they would wager bushel against bushel, as to which
of them could throw the highest. They argued a
while about which was to throw first. At last Aspenclog
had to begin. Now the evil one had a ball with
which they were to throw. Aspenclog stood a long
time looking at the moon. &ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo;
asked the evil one. &ldquo;Well, I would like to see
whether I cannot throw the ball into the moon,&rdquo; said
Aspenclog. &ldquo;Do you see those black spots? Those
are the balls I have already thrown up into the
moon.&rdquo; Then the evil one was afraid of losing his
ball, and he did not dare to let Aspenclog throw.</p>

<p>So they wagered bushel against bushel as to which
one of them could blow the highest note. &ldquo;You may
blow first,&rdquo; said Aspenclog. &ldquo;No, you!&rdquo; Finally
it was decided that Aspenclog should blow first.
Then he went to a hill, took an enormous fir-tree
and wound it around his horn like a reed. &ldquo;Why
do you do that?&rdquo; asked the evil one. &ldquo;Well, if I
don&rsquo;t, the horn will burst when I blow it,&rdquo; was Aspenclog&rsquo;s
answer. Now the evil one began to get
frightened, and Aspenclog came home with half a
ton of money.</p>

<p>But soon the king had no corn left to grind. And
war broke out in the land. &ldquo;Now he will have work
enough to last him a lifetime,&rdquo; thought the king.
And he told Aspenclog to go out against the enemy.
Aspenclog was quite ready to do so; but wanted to
have plenty of provisions to take with him. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he set forth, and when he saw the enemy he sat down
to eat. The enemy shot at him as hard as they could,
but their bullets did not touch him. When Aspenclog
had satisfied his hunger, he stood up, tore out
an enormous oak by the roots, and lay about him
with it. Before very long he had hewn down all of
the enemy. Then he went back home to the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any more work for me?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;No, now I have no work left,&rdquo; said the king.
&ldquo;Then I will give you three good thumps on the
back,&rdquo; said Aspenclog. The king begged permission
to bolster himself up with pillows. &ldquo;Yes, take as
many as you want,&rdquo; said Aspenclog. Then he
thumped, and at his first thump the king burst into
pieces.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE TROLL WEDDING</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> summer, a long, long time ago, the folk of
Melbustad went up to the hill pastures with
their herd. But they had been there only a short
time when the cattle began to grow so restless that
it was impossible to keep them in order. A number
of different maidens tried to manage them, but without
avail; until one came who was betrothed, and
whose betrothal had but recently been celebrated.
Then the cattle suddenly quieted down, and were
easy to handle. So the maiden remained alone in the
hills with no other company than a dog. And one
afternoon as she sat in the hut, it seemed to her that
her sweetheart came, sat down beside her, and began
to talk about their getting married at once. But she
sat still and made no reply, for she noticed a strangeness
about him. By and by, more and more people
came in, and they began to cover the table with silverware,
and bring on dishes, and the bridesmaids
brought the bridal crown, and the ornaments, and a
handsome bridal gown, and they dressed her, and
put the crown on her head, as was the custom in
those days, and they put rings on her hands.</p>

<p>And it seemed to her as though she knew all the
people who were there; they were the women of the
village, and the girls of her own age. But the dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
was well aware that there was something uncanny
about it all. He made his way down to Melbustad in
flying leaps, and howled and barked in the most lamentable
manner, and gave the people no rest until
they followed him. The young fellow who was to
marry the girl took his gun, and climbed the hills;
and when he drew near, there stood a number of
horses around the hut, saddled and bridled. He
crept up to the hut, looked through a loop-hole in
the wall, and saw a whole company sitting together
inside. It was quite evident that they were trolls,
the people from underground, and therefore he discharged
his gun over the roof. At that moment the
doors flew open, and a number of balls of gray yarn,
one larger than the other, came shooting out about
his legs. When he went in, there sat the maiden
in her bridal finery, and nothing was missing but
the ring on her little finger, then all would have been
complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, what has happened here?&rdquo;
he asked, as he looked around. All the silverware
was still on the table, but all the tasty dishes had
turned to moss and toadstools, and frogs and toads
and the like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are sitting
here in all your glory, just like a bride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you ask me?&rdquo; answered the maiden.
&ldquo;You have been sitting here yourself, and talking
about our wedding the whole afternoon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have just come,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It must have
been some one else who had taken my shape!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she gradually came to her senses; but not
until long afterward was she altogether herself, and
she told how she had firmly believed that her sweetheart
himself, and all their friends and relatives had
been there. He took her straight back to the village
with him, and so that they need fear no such deviltry
in the future, they celebrated their wedding
while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the
underground folk. The crown and all the ornaments
were hung up in Melbustad and it is said that they
hang there to this very day.</p>

<p>Black jugglery and deception are practiced upon the poor dairy-maid

From Hadeland, told by a <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Signekjarring</cite>, a kind of wise woman or
herb doctress). Characteristic is the belief that troll magic and
witchery may be nullified if a gun be fired over the place where it
is supposed to be taking place. Then all reverts to its original
form. Curious, also, is the belief that trolls like to turn into skeins
of yarn when disturbed, and then roll swiftly away.</p>

<h2>IX<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE HAT OF THE <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">HULDRES</i></span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a big wedding at a
certain farmstead, and a certain cottager was
on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are
usually made of cows&rsquo; tails, and looking just like an
old brown rag. He picked it up, for he thought it
could be washed, and then he would give it to his
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house
where they were celebrating the wedding, it seemed
as though no one saw him. The bride and groom
nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them
and poured for them; but he got neither greeting
nor drink. Then the chief cook came and asked the
other folk to sit down to the table; but he was not
asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did
not care to sit down of his own accord when no one
had asked him. At last he grew angry and thought:
&ldquo;I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit
of attention to me here.&rdquo; When he reached home,
he said: &ldquo;Good evening, here I am back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, are you back again?&rdquo; asked
his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention
to me, or even so much as looked at me,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;and when people show me so little consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it seems as though I have nothing to look
for there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot
see you!&rdquo; cried his wife.</p>

<p>The man was invisible, for what he had found was
a <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">huldre</i> hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? Can&rsquo;t you see me?
Have you lost your wits?&rdquo; asked the man. &ldquo;There
is an old hair strainer for you. I found it outside
on the ground,&rdquo; said he, and he threw it on the
bench. And then his wife saw him; but at the same
moment the hat of the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">huldres</i> disappeared, for he
should only have loaned it, not given it away. Now
the man saw how everything had come about, and
went back to the wedding-feast. And this time he
was received in right friendly fashion, and was asked
to drink, and to seat himself at the table.</p>

<p>A favorite jewel among the treasures of the underground world

as the tarn-cap, it here finds a more humble place in everyday life,
neither ennobled by legendary dignity, nor diversified by the rich
incident of fairy-tale. The entertaining picture here afforded of its

a charming little daughter; but they were so poor
they did not know how they were going to get her
christened. So her father had to go forth to see
whether he could not find a god-father to pay for the
child&rsquo;s christening. All day long he went from one
to another; but no one wanted to be the god-father.
Toward evening, as he was going home, he met a
very lovely lady, who wore the most splendid clothes,
and seemed most kind and friendly, and she offered
to see that the child was christened, if she might
be allowed to keep it afterward. The man replied
that first he must ask his wife. But when he reached
home and asked her she gave him a flat &ldquo;no.&rdquo; The
following day the man set out again; but no one
wanted to be the god-father if he had to pay for the
christening himself, and no matter how hard the
man begged, it was all of no avail. When he went
home that evening, he again met the lovely lady, who
looked so gentle, and she made him the same offer as
before. The man again told his wife what had happened
to him, and added that if he could not find a
god-father for his child the following day, they would
probably have to let the lady take her, since she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seemed to be so kind and friendly. The man then
went out for the third time, and found no god-father
that day. And so, when he once more met the
friendly lady in the evening, he promised to let her
have the child, if she would see that it was baptized.
The following morning the lady came to the man&rsquo;s
hut, and with her two other men. She then took the
child and went to church with it, and it was baptized.
Then she took it with her, and the little girl
remained with her for several years, and her foster-mother
was always good and kind to her.</p>

<p>Now when the girl had grown old enough to make
distinctions, and had acquired some sense, it chanced
that her foster-mother once wished to take a journey.
&ldquo;You may go into any room you wish,&rdquo; she
said to the girl, &ldquo;only you are not to go into these
three rooms,&rdquo; and then she set out on her journey.
But the girl could not resist opening the door to the
one room a little way&mdash;and swish! out flew a star.
When her foster-mother came home, she was much
grieved to find that the star had flown out, and was
so annoyed with her foster-child that she threatened
to send her away. But the girl pleaded and cried,
until at last she was allowed to remain.</p>

<p>After a time the foster-mother wanted to take another
journey, and she forbade the girl, above all,
to go into the two rooms which, as yet, she had not
entered. And the girl promised her that this time
she would obey her. But when she had been alone
for some time, and had had all sorts of thoughts as
to what there might be in the second room, she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
no longer resist opening the second door a little way&mdash;and
swish! out flew the moon. When the foster-mother
returned, and saw the moon had slipped out,
she again grieved greatly, and told the girl she could
keep her no longer, and that now she must go. But
when the girl again began to cry bitterly, and
pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to
deny her, she was once more allowed to remain.</p>

<p>After this the foster-mother wished to take another
journey, and she told the girl, who was now
more than half-grown, that she must take her request
not to go, or even so much as peep into the
third room, seriously to heart. But when the foster-mother
had been away for some time, and the girl
was all alone and bored, she could at last resist no
longer. &ldquo;O,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;how pleasant it would
be to take a peep into that third room!&rdquo; It is true,
that at first she thought she would not do it, because
of her foster-mother; yet when the thought
returned to her, she could not hold back, after all;
but decided that she should and must by all means
take a peep. So she opened the door the least little
bit&mdash;and swish! out flew the sun. When the foster-mother
then returned, and saw that the sun had
flown out, she grieved greatly, and told the girl that
now she could positively stay with her no longer.
The foster-daughter cried and pleaded even more
touchingly than before; but all to no avail. &ldquo;No, I
must now punish you,&rdquo; said the foster-mother.
&ldquo;But you shall have your choice of either becoming
the most beautiful of all maidens, without the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of speech, or the most homely, yet able to talk. But
you must leave this place.&rdquo; The girl said: &ldquo;Then I
would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without
the power of speech&rdquo;&mdash;and such she became, but
from that time on she was dumb.</p>

<p>Now when the girl had left her foster-mother, and
had wandered for a time, she came to a large, large
wood, and no matter how far she went she could not
reach its end. When evening came, she climbed into
a high tree that stood over a spring, and sat down
in its branches to sleep. Not far from it stood a
king&rsquo;s castle, and early the next morning a serving-maid
came from it, to get water from the spring for
the prince&rsquo;s tea. And when the serving-maid saw
the lovely face in the spring, she thought it was her
own. At once she threw down her pail and ran back
home holding her head high, and saying: &ldquo;If I am
as beautiful as all that, I am too good to carry water
in a pail!&rdquo; Then another was sent to fetch water,
but the same thing happened with her; she, too, came
back and said she was far too handsome and too
good to go to the spring and fetch water for the
prince. Then the prince went himself, for he wanted
to see what it all meant. And when he came to the
spring, he also saw the picture, and at once looked
up into the tree. And so he saw the lovely maiden
who was seated among its branches. He coaxed her
down, took her back home with him, and nothing
would do but that she must be his bride, because she
was so beautiful. But his mother, who was still
living, objected: &ldquo;She cannot speak,&rdquo; said she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
&ldquo;and, maybe, she belongs to the troll-folk.&rdquo; But the
prince would not be satisfied until he had won her.
When, after a time, heaven bestowed a child upon
the queen, the prince set a strong guard about her.
But suddenly they all fell asleep, and her foster-mother
came, cut the child&rsquo;s little finger, rubbed
some of the blood over the mouth and hands of the
queen, and said: &ldquo;Now you shall grieve just as I did
when you let the star slip out!&rdquo; And with that she
disappeared with the child. When those whom the
prince had set to keep guard opened their eyes again,
they thought that the queen had devoured her child,
and the old queen wanted to have her burned; but
the prince loved her so very tenderly, that after
much pleading he succeeded in having her saved
from punishment, though only with the greatest
difficulty.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;AND SO HE SAW THE LOVELY MAIDEN WHO WAS SEATED AMONG
ITS BRANCHES.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="flr">&mdash;Page 59</span></span>
</div>

<p>When heaven gave her a second child, a guard of
twice as many men as had first stood watch was
again set about her; yet everything happened as before,
only that this time the foster-mother said to
her: &ldquo;Now you shall grieve as I did when you let the
moon slip out!&rdquo; The queen wept and pleaded&mdash;for
when the foster-mother was there she could speak&mdash;but
without avail. Now the old queen insisted that
she be burned. But the prince once more succeeded
in begging her free. When heaven gave her a third
child, a three-fold guard was set about her. The
foster-mother came while the guard slept, took the
child, cut its little finger, and rubbed some of the
blood on the queen&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
shall grieve just as I did when you let the sun slip
out!&rdquo; And now the prince could in no way save her,
she was to be and should be burned. But at the very
moment when they were leading her to the stake, the
foster-mother appeared with all three children; the
two older ones she led by the hand, the youngest she
carried on her arm. She stepped up to the young
queen and said: &ldquo;Here are your children, for now
I give them back to you. I am the Virgin Mary, and
the grief that you have felt is the same grief that I
felt aforetimes, when you had let the star, the moon
and the sun slip out. Now you have been punished
for that which you did, and from now on the power
of speech is restored to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The happiness which then filled the prince and
princess may be imagined, but cannot be described.
They lived happily together ever after, and from
that time forward even the prince&rsquo;s mother was very
fond of the young queen.</p>

<h2>XI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">STORM MAGIC</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> cabin-boy had been traveling around all
summer long with his captain; but when they
began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew
restless and did not want to go along. The captain
liked him, for though he was no more than a boy,
he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall lad,
and did not mind lending a hand when need arose;
then, too, he did as much work as an able seaman,
and was so full of fun that he kept the whole crew
in good humor. And so the captain did not like
to lose him. But the youth said out and out that
he was not minded to take to the blue pond in the
fall; though he was willing to stay on board till the
ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday,
while the crew was ashore, and the captain had gone
to a farm-holding near the forest, in order to bargain
for small timber and log wood&mdash;presumably on
his own account&mdash;for a deck load, the youth had been
left to guard the ship. But you must know that he
was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf
clover; and that was the reason he had the second
sight. He could see those who are invisible, but
they could not see him.</p>

<p>And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he heard voices within the ship. He peered through
a crack, and there were three coal-black crows sitting
inside the deck-beams, and they were talking about
their husbands. All three were tired of them, and
were planning their death. One could see at once
that they were witches, who had assumed another
form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it certain that there is no one here who
can overhear us?&rdquo; said one of the crows. And by
the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for the
captain&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you can see there&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said the others, the
wives of the first and second quartermasters.
&ldquo;There is not a soul aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of
a good way to get rid of them,&rdquo; said the captain&rsquo;s
wife once more, and hopped closer to the two others.
&ldquo;We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them
into the sea, and sink the ship with every man on
board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That pleased the others, and they sat there a long
time discussing the day and the fairway. &ldquo;But is
it certain that no one can overhear us?&rdquo; once more
asked the captain&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that such is the case,&rdquo; said the two
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish
to do, and if it is used, it will go hard with us, for
it will cost us nothing less than our lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the counter-spell, sister,&rdquo; asked the wife
of the one quartermaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It
seemed to me as though some one were smoking in
the forward cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know we looked in every corner. They
just forgot to let the fire go out in the caboose, and
that is why there&rsquo;s smoke,&rdquo; said the quartermaster&rsquo;s
wife, &ldquo;so tell away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they buy three cords of birch-wood,&rdquo; said the
witch,&mdash;&ldquo;but it must be full measure, and they must
not bargain for it&mdash;and throw the first cord into the
water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,
and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second
breaker strikes, and the third cord, billet by billet,
when the third breaker strikes, then it is all up
with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true, sister, then it is all up with us!
Then it is all up with us!&rdquo; said the wives of the
quartermasters; &ldquo;but there is no one who knows
it,&rdquo; they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that
they flew out of the hatchway, screaming and croaking
like ravens.</p>

<p>When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not
go along for anything in the world; and all the captain&rsquo;s
coaxing, and all his promises were useless,
nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked
him whether he were afraid, because fall was at
hand, and said he would rather hide behind the stove,
hanging to mother&rsquo;s apron strings. No, said the
youth, he was not afraid, and they could not say
that they had ever seen him show a sign of so land-lubberly
a thing as fear; and he was willing to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
it to them, for now he was going along with them,
but he made it a condition that three cords of birch-wood
were to be bought, full measure, and that on a
certain day he was to have command, just as though
he himself were the captain. The captain asked
what sort of nonsense this might be, and whether
he had ever heard of a cabin-boy&rsquo;s being entrusted
with the command of a ship. But the boy answered
that was all one to him; if they did not care to buy
the three cords of birch-wood, and obey him, as
though he were captain, for the space of a single
day&mdash;the captain and crew should know which day
it was to be in advance&mdash;then he would set foot on
the ship no more, and far less would he ever dirty
his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The
whole thing seemed strange to the captain, yet he
finally gave in, because he wanted to have the boy
along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that
he would come to his senses again when they were
once under way. The quartermaster was of the
same opinion. &ldquo;Just let him command all he likes,
and if things go wrong with him, we&rsquo;ll help him out,&rdquo;
said he. So the birch-wood was bought, full-measure
and without haggling, and they set sail.</p>

<p>When the day came on which the cabin-boy was
to take command, the weather was fair and quiet;
but he drummed up the whole ship&rsquo;s crew, and with
the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails
reefed. The captain and crew laughed at him, and
said: &ldquo;That shows the sort of a captain we have
now. Don&rsquo;t you want us to reef that last bit of sail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
this very minute?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered the cabin-boy,
&ldquo;but before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so
heavily that they thought they would capsize, and
had they not reefed the sails they would undoubtedly
have foundered when the first breaker roared
down upon the ship.</p>

<p>The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of
birch-wood overboard, billet by billet, one at a time
and never two, and he did not let them touch the
other two cords. Now they obeyed him to the letter,
and did not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet
by billet. When the last billet fell they heard a
groaning, as though some one were wrestling with
death, and then the squall had passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said the crew&mdash;and the captain
added: &ldquo;I am going to let the company know
that you saved ship and cargo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well, but we are not through
yet,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;there is worse to come,&rdquo; and he
told them to reef every last rag, as well as what had
been left of the topsails. The second squall hit them
with even greater force than the first, and was so
vicious and violent that the whole crew was frightened.
While it was at its worst, the boy told them
to throw overboard the second cord; and they threw
it over billet by billet, and took care not to take any
from the third cord. When the last billet fell, they
again heard a deep groan, and then all was still.
&ldquo;Now there will be one more squall, and that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be the worst,&rdquo; said the boy, and sent every one to
his station. There was not a hawser loose on the
whole ship.</p>

<p>The last squall hit them with far more force than
either of the preceding ones, the ship laid over on
her side so that they thought she would not right
herself again, and the breaker swept over the deck.</p>

<p>But the boy told them to throw the last cord of
wood overboard, billet by billet, and no two billets
at once. And when the last billet of wood fell, they
heard a deep groaning, as though some one were
dying hard, and when all was quiet once more, the
whole sea was the color of blood, as far as eye could
reach.</p>

<p>When they reached land, the captain and the quartermasters
spoke of writing to their wives. &ldquo;That
is something you might just as well let be,&rdquo; said the
cabin-boy, &ldquo;seeing that you no longer have any
wives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What silly talk is this, young know-it-all! We
have no wives?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Or do you happen
to have done away with them?&rdquo; asked the quartermasters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, all of us together did away with them,&rdquo; answered
the boy, and told them what he had heard
and seen that Sunday afternoon when he was on
watch on the ship; while the crew was ashore, and
the captain was buying his deckload of wood.</p>

<p>And when they sailed home they learned that their
wives had disappeared the day of the storm, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
since that time no one had seen or heard anything
more of them.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">NOTE</p>

<p>A weird tale of the sea and of witches is that of &ldquo;Storm Magic&rdquo;
(Asbjörnsen, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Huldreeventyr</cite>, I, p.&nbsp;248. From the vicinity of Christiania,
told by a sailor, Rasmus Olsen). In the &ldquo;Fritjof Legend&rdquo;
the hero has a similar adventure at sea with two witches, who call
up a tremendous storm. It would be interesting to know the inner
context of the cabin-boy&rsquo;s counter magic, and why it is that the
birch-wood, cast into the sea billet by billet, had the power to
destroy the witches.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE FOUR-SHILLING PIECE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a poor woman, who
lived in a wretched hut far away from the village.
She had but little to bite and less to burn, so
she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood.
He skipped and leaped, and leaped and skipped, in
order to keep warm, for it was a cold, gray autumn
day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a
branch to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms
against his shoulders, for the cold made his hands
as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he
walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was
wandering homeward, he crossed a field of stubble.
There he saw lying a jagged white stone. &ldquo;O, you
poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You
must be freezing terribly!&rdquo; said the boy; took off
his jacket, and laid it over the stone. And when
he came back home with his wood, his mother asked
him how it was that he was going around in the
autumn cold in his shirt-sleeves. He told her that
he had seen a jagged old stone, quite white and pale
with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket.
&ldquo;You fool,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;do you think a stone
can freeze? And even if it had chattered with frost,
still, charity begins at home. Your clothes cost
enough as it is, even when you don&rsquo;t hang them on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the stones out in the field!&rdquo;&mdash;and with that she
drove the boy out again to fetch his jacket. When
he came to the stone, the stone had turned around,
and had raised itself from the ground on one side.
&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m sure it is because you have the jacket,
poor fellow!&rdquo; said the boy. But when he looked
more closely, there was a chest full of bright silver
coins under the stone. &ldquo;That must be stolen
money,&rdquo; thought the boy, &ldquo;for no one lays money
honestly earned under stones in the wood.&rdquo; And
he took the chest, and carried it down to the pond
nearby, and threw in the whole pile of money. But
a four-shilling piece was left swimming on the top
of the water. &ldquo;Well, this one is honest, for whatever
is honest will float,&rdquo; said the boy. And he took
the four-shilling piece and the jacket home with him.
He told his mother what had happened to him, that
the stone had turned around, and that he had found
a chest full of silver coins, and had thrown it into
the pond because it was stolen money. &ldquo;But a four-shilling
piece floated, and that I took along, because
it was honest,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; said
the woman&mdash;for she was as angry as could be&mdash;&ldquo;if
nothing were honest save what floats on the water,
there would be but little honesty left in the world.
And if the money had been stolen ten times over,
still you had found it, and charity begins at home.
If you had kept the money, we might have passed
the rest of our lives in peace and comfort. But
you are a dunderhead and will stay a dunderhead,
and I won&rsquo;t be tormented and burdened with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
any longer. Now you must get out and earn your
own living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boy had to go out into the wide world, and
wandered about far and near looking for service.
But wherever he went people found him too small or
too weak, and said that they could make no use
of him. At last he came to a merchant. There they
kept him to work in the kitchen, and he had to fetch
wood and water for the cook. When he had been
there for some time, the merchant decided to journey
to far countries, and asked all his servants what
he should buy and bring back home for them. After
all had told him what they wanted, came the turn of
the little fellow who carried wood and water for the
kitchen. He handed him his four-shilling piece.
&ldquo;Well, and what am I to buy for it?&rdquo; asked the
merchant. &ldquo;It will not be a large purchase.&rdquo; &ldquo;Buy
whatever it will bring, it is honest money, that I
know,&rdquo; said the boy. His master promised to do so,
and sailed away.</p>

<p>Now when the merchant had discharged his cargo
in foreign parts and had reloaded, and had bought
what his servants had desired, he went back to his
ship, and was about to shove off. Not until then did
he remember that the scullion had given him a four-shilling
piece, with which to buy him something.
&ldquo;Must I go up to the city again because of this
four-shilling piece? One only has one&rsquo;s troubles
when one bothers with such truck,&rdquo; thought the
merchant. Then along came a woman with a bag on
her back. &ldquo;What have you in your bag, granny?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
asked the merchant. &ldquo;O, it is only a cat! I can
feed her no longer, and so I want to throw her into
the sea in order to get rid of her,&rdquo; said the old
woman. &ldquo;The boy told me to buy whatever I could
get for the four-shilling piece,&rdquo; said the merchant
to himself, and asked the woman whether he could
have her cat for four shillings. The woman agreed
without delay, and the bargain was closed.</p>

<p>Now when the merchant had sailed on for a while,
a terrible storm broke loose, a thunderstorm without
an equal, and he drifted and drifted, and did not
know where or whither. At last he came to a land
where he had never yet been, and went up into the
city.</p>

<p>In the tavern which he entered the table was set,
and at every place lay a switch, one for each guest.
This seemed strange to the merchant, for he could
not understand what was to be done with all the
switches. Yet he sat down and thought: &ldquo;I will
watch carefully, and see just what the rest do with
them, and then I can imitate them.&rdquo; Yes, and when
the food came on the table, then he knew why the
switches were there: the place was alive with thousands
of mice, and all who were sitting at the table
had to work and fight and beat about them with their
switches, and nothing could be heard but the slapping
of the switches, one worse than the other.
Sometimes people hit each other in the face, and
then they had to take time to say, &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eating is hard work in this country,&rdquo; said the
merchant. &ldquo;How is it the folk here have no cats?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cats?&rdquo; said the people: they did not know what
they were. Then the merchant had the cat that he
had bought for the scullion brought, and when the
cat went over the table, the mice had to hurry into
their holes, and not in the memory of man had the
people been able to eat in such comfort. Then they
begged and implored the merchant to sell them his
cat. At last he said he would let them have her;
but he wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this
they paid, and thanked him kindly into the bargain.</p>

<p>Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he
reached the high seas than he saw the cat sitting at
the top of the main-mast. And immediately after
another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the
first one, and he drifted and drifted, till he came to
a land where he had never yet been. Again the merchant
went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was
covered with switches; but they were much larger
and longer than at the place where he had first been.
And they were much needed; for there were a good
many more mice, and they were twice the size of
those he had first seen.</p>

<p>Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received
two hundred dollars for her, and that without
any haggling. But when he had sailed off and was
out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast.
And the storm at once began again, and finally he
was again driven to a land in which he had never
been. Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the
table was also covered with switches; but every
switch was a yard and a half long, and as thick as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a small broom, and the people told him that they
knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down
to eat, for there were great, ugly rats by the thousand.
Only with toil and trouble could one manage
to shove a bite of something into one&rsquo;s mouth once
in a while, so hard was it to defend oneself against
the rats. Then the cat was again brought from the
ship, and now the people could eat in peace. They
begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his
cat; and for a long time he refused; but at last he
promised that they should have her for three hundred
dollars. And they paid him, and thanked him,
and blessed him into the bargain.</p>

<p>Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he
considered how much the boy had gained with the
four-shilling piece he had given him. &ldquo;Well, he
shall have some of the money,&rdquo; said the merchant
to himself, &ldquo;but not all of it. For he has to thank
me for the cat, which I bought for him, and charity
begins at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while the merchant was thinking these
thoughts, such a storm and tempest arose that all
thought the ship would sink. Then the merchant
realized that there was nothing left for him to do
but to promise that the boy should have all the
money. No sooner had he made his vow, than the
weather turned fair, and he had a favoring wind
for his journey home. And when he landed, he gave
the youth the six hundred dollars and his daughter
to boot. For now the scullion was as rich as the
merchant himself and richer, and thereafter he lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in splendor and happiness. And he took in his
mother and treated her kindly. &ldquo;For I do not believe
that charity begins at home,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>

<span class="f8">THE MAGIC APPLES</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a lad who was
better off than all the others. He was never
short of money, for he had a purse which was never
empty. He never was short of food, for he had a
table-cloth on which, as soon as he spread it, he
found all he wanted to eat and drink. And, besides,
he had a magic wishing cap. When he put it on he
could wish himself wherever he wanted, and there
he would be that very moment.</p>

<p>There was only one thing that he lacked: he had
no wife, and he was gradually coming into the years
when it would be necessary for him to make haste.</p>

<p>As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it
occurred to him to wish himself where he would find
the most beautiful princess in the world. No sooner
had he thought of it than he was there. And it was
a land which he had never yet seen, and a city in
which he had never yet been. And the king had a
daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld
her like, and he wanted to have her on the spot. But
she would have nothing to do with him, and was very
haughty.</p>

<p>Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside
himself that he could no longer be where she was not.
So he took his magic cap and wished himself into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
castle. He wanted to say good-by, so he said. And
she laid her hand in his. &ldquo;I wish we were far beyond
the end of the world!&rdquo; said the youth, and
there they were. But the king&rsquo;s daughter wept, and
begged to be allowed to go home again. He could
have all the gold and silver in the castle in return.
&ldquo;I have money enough for myself,&rdquo; said the youth,
and he shook his purse so that money just rolled
about. He could sit down at the royal table and eat
the finest food, and drink the finest wines, said she.
&ldquo;I have enough to eat and drink myself,&rdquo; said the
youth. &ldquo;See, you can sit down at the table,&rdquo; said
he, and at once he spread his table-cloth. And there
stood a table covered with the best one might wish;
and the king himself ate no better.</p>

<p>After they had eaten, the king&rsquo;s daughter said:
&ldquo;O, do look at the handsome apples up there on the
tree! If you were really kind, you would fetch me
down a couple of them!&rdquo; The youth was not lazy,
and climbed up. But he had forgotten his table-cloth
and his purse, and these she took. And while
he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off. She
at once put it on and wished herself back in her
own room, and there she was that minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have known it,&rdquo; said the youth to
himself, and hurried down the tree. He began to
cry and did not know what to do. And as he was
sitting there, he sampled the apples which he had
thrown down. No sooner had he tried one than he
had a strange feeling in his head, and when he
looked more closely, he had a pair of horns. &ldquo;Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
now it can do me no more harm,&rdquo; said he, and calmly
went on eating the apples. But suddenly the horns
had disappeared, and he was as before. &ldquo;Good
enough!&rdquo; said the youth. And with that he put the
apples in his pocket, and set out to search for the
king&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>He went from city to city, and sailed from country
to country; but it was a long journey, and lasted a
year and a day, and even longer.</p>

<p>But one day he got there after all. It was a
Sunday, and he found out that the king&rsquo;s daughter
was at church. Then he sat himself down with his
apples before the church door, and pretended to be
a peddler. &ldquo;Apples of Damascus! Apples of
Damascus!&rdquo; he cried. And sure enough, the king&rsquo;s
daughter came, and told her maidens to go and see
what desirable things the peddler from abroad might
have to offer. Yes, he had apples of Damascus.
&ldquo;What do the apples give one?&rdquo; asked the maiden.
&ldquo;Wisdom and beauty!&rdquo; said the peddler, and the
maiden bought.</p>

<p>When the king&rsquo;s daughter had eaten of the apples,
she had a pair of horns. And then there was
such a wailing in the castle that it was pitiful to
hear. And the castle was hung with black, and in
the whole kingdom proclamation was made from all
pulpits that whoever could help the king&rsquo;s daughter
should get her, and half the kingdom besides. Then
Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in
the country came along. But none of them could
help the princess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to
court. He was not from their country, he said, and
had made the journey purposely just to try his luck
here. But he must see the king&rsquo;s daughter alone,
said he, and permission was granted him.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s daughter recognized him, and grew red
and pale in turn. &ldquo;If I help you now, will you
marry me?&rdquo; asked the youth. Yes, indeed she
would. Then he gave her one of the magic apples,
and her horns were only half as large as before.
&ldquo;But I cannot do more until I have my cap, and
my table-cloth, and my purse back again,&rdquo; said he.
So she went and brought him the things. Then he
gave her still another magic apple, and now the
horns were no more than tiny hornlets. &ldquo;But now I
cannot go on until you have sworn that you will be
true to me,&rdquo; said he. And she swore that she would.
And after she had eaten the third apple, her forehead
was quite smooth again, and she was even
more beautiful than in days gone by.</p>

<p>Then there was great joy in the castle. They prepared
for the wedding with baking and brewing, and
invited people from East and West to come to it.
And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good
cheer, and if they have not stopped, they are merry
and of good cheer to this very day!</p>

<span class="f8">SELF DID IT</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a mill, in which it
was impossible to grind flour, because such
strange things kept happening there. But there was
a poor woman who was in urgent need of a little
meal one evening, and she asked whether they would
not allow her to grind a little flour during the night.
&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said the mill-owner, &ldquo;that is
quite impossible! There are ghosts enough in the
mill as it is.&rdquo; But the woman said that she must
grind a little; for she did not have a pinch of flour
in the house with which to make mush, and there was
nothing for her children to eat. So at last he allowed
her to go to the mill at night and grind some
flour. When she came, she lit a fire under a big tar-barrel
that was standing there; got the mill going,
sat down by the fire, and began to knit. After a time
a girl came in and nodded to her. &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo;
said she to the woman. &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; said the
woman; kept her seat, and went on knitting. But
then the girl who had come in began to pull apart
the fire on the hearth. The woman built it up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked the girl from underground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Self is my name,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>That seemed a curious name to the girl, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
once more began to pull the fire apart. Then the
woman grew angry and began to scold, and built it
all up again. Thus they went on for a good while;
but at last, while they were in the midst of their
pulling apart and building up of the fire, the woman
upset the tar-barrel on the girl from underground.
Then the latter screamed and ran away, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, father! Self burned me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, if self did it, then self must suffer
for it!&rdquo; came the answer from below the hill.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE MASTER GIRL</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a king who had
several sons; I do not just know how many
there were, but the youngest was not content at
home, and insisted on going out into the world to
seek his fortune. And in the end the king had to
give him permission to do so. After he had wandered
for a few days, he came to a giant&rsquo;s castle,
and took service with the giant. In the morning
the giant wanted to go off to herd his goats, and
when he started he told the king&rsquo;s son he was to
clean the stable in the meantime. &ldquo;And when you
are through with that, you need do nothing more
for to-day, for you might as well know that you have
come to a kind master,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you must
do what you are told to do conscientiously and, besides,
you must not go into any of the rooms that
lie behind the one in which you slept last night, else
your life will pay the forfeit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He surely is a kind master,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son
to himself, walked up and down the room, and
whistled and sang; for, thought he, there would be
plenty of time to clean the stable. &ldquo;But it would
be nice to take a look at the other room, there surely
must be something in it that he is alarmed about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
since I am not so much as to take a look,&rdquo; thought
he, and went into the first room. There hung a kettle,
and it was boiling, but the king&rsquo;s son could find
no fire beneath it. &ldquo;What can there be in it?&rdquo;
thought he, and dipped in a lock of his hair, and at
once the hair grew just like copper. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
fine soup, and whoever tastes it will burn his
mouth,&rdquo; said the youth, and went into the next room.
There hung another kettle that bubbled and boiled;
but there was no fire beneath it, either. &ldquo;I must try
this one, too,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son, and again he
dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like
silver. &ldquo;We have no such expensive soup at home,&rdquo;
said the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;but the main thing is, how
does it taste?&rdquo; and with that he went into the third
room. And there hung still another kettle, a-boiling
just like those in the two other rooms, and the king&rsquo;s
son wanted to try this one, too. He dipped in a lock
of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly
shimmered.</p>

<p>Then the king&rsquo;s son said: &ldquo;Better and better!
But if he cooks gold here, I wonder what he cooks
inside, there?&rdquo; And he wanted to see, so he went
into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to
be seen; but a maiden sat on a bench who must have
been a king&rsquo;s daughter; yet whatever she might be,
the king&rsquo;s son had never seen any one so beautiful
in all his days. &ldquo;Now in heaven&rsquo;s name, what are
you doing here?&rdquo; asked the maiden. &ldquo;I hired myself
out here yesterday,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;May
God be your aid, for it is a fine service you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
chosen!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;O, the master is very friendly,&rdquo;
said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;He has given me no hard work
to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I
need do nothing more.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but how are you going
to manage it?&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;If you do as the
others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch
out, ten fresh shovelfuls will fly in. But I&rsquo;ll tell you
how to go about it. You must turn around the
shovel, and work with the handle, then everything
will fly out by itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he would do, said the king&rsquo;s son; and he sat
there with her all day long, for they had soon agreed
that they would marry, he and the king&rsquo;s daughter,
and in this way his first day in the giant&rsquo;s service
did not weary him at all. When evening came on,
she told him that now he must clean out the stable
before the giant came, and when he got there he
thought he would try out her advice, and began to
use the shovel as he had seen his father&rsquo;s grooms
use it. And sure enough, he had to stop quickly, for
after he had worked a little while, he hardly had
room in which to stand. Then he did as the king&rsquo;s
daughter had told him, turned the shovel around
and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was
as clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he
had finished he went to the room that the giant had
assigned him, and walked up and down, whistling
and singing. Then the giant came home with his
goats. &ldquo;Have you cleaned out the stable?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, master, it is spick and span,&rdquo; said the
king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see that,&rdquo; said the giant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and went into the stable; but it was just as the king&rsquo;s
son had said. &ldquo;You surely have been talking to the
Master Girl, for you could not have done that
alone,&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;Master Girl? What is a
Master Girl?&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son, and pretended to
be very stupid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see her, too.&rdquo; &ldquo;You
will see her in plenty of time,&rdquo; said the giant.</p>

<p>The next morning the giant went off again with
his goats. And he told the king&rsquo;s son he was to fetch
his horse from the pasture, and when he had done
this, he might rest: &ldquo;For you have come to a kind
master,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But if you enter one of the
rooms which I forbade you entering yesterday, I will
tear off your head,&rdquo; he said, and went away with his
herd. &ldquo;Indeed, you are a kind master,&rdquo; said the
king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;but in spite of it I&rsquo;d like to have another
little talk with the Master Girl, for she is just
as much mine as yours,&rdquo; and with that he went in to
her. She asked him what work he had to do that
day. &ldquo;O, it is not so bad to-day,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;I am only to fetch his horse from the pasture.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And how are you going to manage that?&rdquo;
asked the Master Girl. &ldquo;Surely it is no great feat
to fetch a horse from pasture,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son,
&ldquo;and I have ridden swift horses before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet it is
not an easy matter to ride this horse home,&rdquo; said
the Master Girl, &ldquo;but I will tell you how to set about
it: When you see the horse, he will come running
up, breathing fire and flame, just as though he were
a burning pine-torch. Then you must take the bit
that is hanging here on the door, and throw it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
his mouth, for then he will grow so tame that you
can do what you will with him.&rdquo; He would take
good note of it, said the king&rsquo;s son, and he sat there
with the Master Girl the whole day long, and they
chatted and talked about this and that, but mainly
about how delightful it would be, and what a pleasant
time they could have, if they could only marry and
get away from the giant. And the king&rsquo;s son would
have forgotten the pasture and the horse altogether,
had not the Master Girl reminded him of them
toward evening. He took the bit that hung in the
corner, hurried out to the pasture, and the horse
at once ran up, breathing fire and flame; but he
seized the moment when he came running up to him
with his jaws wide open, and threw the bit into his
mouth. Then he stood still, as gentle as a young
lamb, and he had no trouble bringing him to the
stable. Then he went to his room again, and began
to whistle and sing. In the evening the giant came
home with his goats. &ldquo;Did you fetch the horse?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;It
would make a fine saddle-horse, but I just took it
straight to the stable.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to see that,&rdquo; said
the giant, and went into the stable. But there stood
the horse, just as the king&rsquo;s son had said. &ldquo;You
surely must have spoken to my Master Girl, for you
could not have done that alone,&rdquo; said the giant.
&ldquo;Yesterday the master chattered about the Master
Girl, and to-day he is talking about her again. I
wish master would show me the creature, for I surely
would like to see her,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son, and pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to be very simple and stupid. &ldquo;You will get
to see her in plenty of time,&rdquo; said the giant.</p>

<p>On the third morning the giant went off again with
his goats. &ldquo;To-day you must go to the devil, and
fetch me his tribute,&rdquo; said he to the king&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;When you have done that, you may rest for the
remainder of the time, for you have come to a kind
master, and you might as well know it,&rdquo; and with
that he went off. &ldquo;You may be a kind master,&rdquo; said
the king&rsquo;s son; &ldquo;yet you hand over some pretty mean
jobs to me in spite of it, but I think I&rsquo;ll look after
your Master Girl a bit. You claim that she belongs
to you, but perhaps, in spite of it, she may tell me
what to do,&rdquo; and with that he went in to her. And
when the Master Girl asked him what the giant had
given him to do that day, he told her he must go to
the devil and fetch a tribute. &ldquo;But how will you go
about it?&rdquo; asked the Master Girl. &ldquo;You will have
to tell me that,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;for I have
never been to the devil&rsquo;s place, and even though I
knew the way there, I still would not know how
much to ask for.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will tell you what you must
do,&rdquo; said the Master Girl. &ldquo;You must go to the
rock behind the pasture, and take the club that is
lying there, and strike the rock with it. Then one
will come out whose eyes flash fire, and you must
tell him your business. And if he asks how much
you want, you must tell him as much as you can
carry.&rdquo; He would take good note of it, said the
king&rsquo;s son, and he sat there with the Master Girl
all day long until evening, and he might be sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
there yet, if the Master Girl had not reminded him
that he must still go to the devil about the tribute
before the giant came home. So he set out, and did
exactly as the Master Girl had told him: he went
to the rock, took the club and beat against it. Then
one came out from whose eyes and nose the sparks
flew. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The giant
has sent me to fetch his tribute,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; the other again inquired.
&ldquo;I never ask for more than I can carry,&rdquo;
was the reply of the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;It is lucky for
you that you did not ask for a whole ton at once,&rdquo;
said the one on the hill. &ldquo;But come in with me, and
wait a while.&rdquo; This the king&rsquo;s son did, and saw a
great deal of gold and silver lying in the hill like
dead rock in an ore-pile. Then as much as he could
carry was packed up, and with it he went his way.
When the giant came home in the evening with his
goats, the king&rsquo;s son was running about the room,
whistling and singing as on the two preceding evenings.
&ldquo;Did you go to the devil for the tribute?&rdquo;
asked the giant. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, master,&rdquo; said the
king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Where did you put it?&rdquo; asked the giant
again. &ldquo;I stood the sack of gold outside on the
bench,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I must see that at once,&rdquo;
said the giant, and went over to the bench. But the
sack was really standing there, and it was so full
that the gold and silver rolled right out when
the giant loosened the string. &ldquo;You surely must
have spoken to my Master Girl,&rdquo; said the giant.
&ldquo;If that is the case I will tear your head off.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
&ldquo;With your Master Girl?&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;Yesterday master talked about that Master Girl,
and to-day he is talking about her again, and the day
before yesterday he talked about her, too! I only
wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Well, just wait until to-morrow,&rdquo;
said the giant, &ldquo;and then I will lead you to her myself,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;A thousand thanks, master,&rdquo; said
the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;but I think you are only joking!&rdquo;
The following day the giant took him to the Master
Girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in
the big kettle, you know which one I mean. And
when the soup is ready, you can call me,&rdquo; said the
giant, and he lay down on the bench to sleep, and
at once began to snore so that the hills shook. Then
the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the youth&rsquo;s
little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the
bench. Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes
and other rubbish she could find, and threw them all
into the kettle. And then she took a chest of gold-dust,
and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that
hung over the door, and a golden apple, and two
golden hens, and left the giant&rsquo;s castle together with
the king&rsquo;s son as quickly as possible. After a time
they came to the sea, and they sailed across; though
where they got the ship I do not exactly know.</p>

<p>Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a
while, he began to stretch himself on his bench. &ldquo;Is
dinner ready yet?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Just begun!&rdquo; said
the first drop of blood on the bench. Then the giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
turned around, went to sleep again, and went on
sleeping for quite some time. Then he again turned
around a little. &ldquo;Is dinner not ready yet?&rdquo; he said,
but did not open his eyes&mdash;nor had he done so the
first time&mdash;for he was still half asleep. &ldquo;It is half
ready!&rdquo; called out the second drop of blood, and
then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He
turned around on the bench and took another nap.
After he had slept a couple of hours longer, he once
more began to move about and stretch: &ldquo;Is dinner
still not ready?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; answered the
third drop of blood. The giant sat up and rubbed
his eyes. But he could not see who had called him,
and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one
answered him. &ldquo;O, I suppose she has gone out for
a little,&rdquo; thought the giant, and he dipped his spoon
in the kettle to try the dinner; but there was nothing
but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked
together, and he did not know whether it were mush
or porridge. When he noticed this he began to see
a light, and realize how matters had come to pass,
and he grew so angry that he hardly knew what to
do, and made after the king&rsquo;s son and the Master
Girl in flying haste. In a short time he came to the
sea, and could not cross. &ldquo;But I know how to help
myself,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I will fetch my sea-sucker.&rdquo; So
the sea-sucker came, and lay down and took two or
three swallows, and thus lowered the water so that
the giant could see the king&rsquo;s son and the Master
Girl out on the ship. &ldquo;Now you must throw the
lick-stone overboard,&rdquo; said the Master Girl, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the king&rsquo;s son did so. It turned into a tremendous
large rock square across the sea, and the giant could
not get over, and the sea-sucker could drink up no
more of the sea. &ldquo;I know quite well what I must
do,&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;I must now fetch my hill-borer.&rdquo;
So the hill-borer came, and bored a hole
through the rock, so the sea-sucker could get through
and keep on sucking. But no sooner were they thus
far than the Master Girl told the king&rsquo;s son to pour
a drop or so of the bottle overboard, and the sea
grew so full that they had landed before the sea-sucker
could so much as take a single swallow.</p>

<p>Now they wanted to go home to the father of
the king&rsquo;s son; but he would not hear of the Master
Girl&rsquo;s going afoot, since he did not think this fitting
for either of them. &ldquo;Wait here a little while, until
I fetch the seven horses that stand in my father&rsquo;s
stable,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;It is not far, and I
will soon be back; for I will not have my bride come
marching home afoot.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, do not do so, for when
you get home to the castle you will forget me, I know
that positively,&rdquo; said the Master Girl. &ldquo;How could
I forget you?&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;We have
passed through so many hardships together, and we
love each other so dearly,&rdquo; said he. He wanted to
fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs, and
she was to wait by the seashore. So at last the
Master Girl had to give in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when you get there, you must not take time
to greet a single person. You must at once go to
the stable, harness the horses, and drive back as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
swiftly as you can. They will all come to meet you,
but you must act as though you did not see them,
and must not take a single bite to eat. If you do
not do that, you will make both of us unhappy,&rdquo; said
she. And he promised to do as she had said.</p>

<p>But when he got home to the castle, one of his
brothers was just getting married, and the bride and
all the guests were already there. They all crowded
around him and asked him this, and asked him that,
and wanted to lead him in. But he acted as though
he saw none of them, led out the horses, and began to
put them to the coach. And since they could by no
manner of means induce him to come into the castle,
they came out with food and drink, and offered him
the best of all that had been prepared for the wedding
feast.</p>

<p>But the king&rsquo;s son would taste nothing, and only
made haste in order to get away. Yet, finally, the
bride&rsquo;s sister rolled an apple over to him across
the court-yard: &ldquo;And if you will touch nothing else,
then at least you might take a bite of the apple, for
you must be hungry and thirsty after your long
journey,&rdquo; said she, and he took the apple and bit
into it. But no sooner did he have the bit of apple
in his mouth than he had forgotten the Master Girl,
and that he was to fetch her. &ldquo;I think I must be
going mad! What am I doing with the horses and
the coach?&rdquo; he said, and he led back the horses into
the stable, and went back to the castle, and wanted to
marry the bride&rsquo;s sister, the one who had thrown
him the apple.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime the Master Girl sat by the seashore,
and waited and waited; but no king&rsquo;s son
came. Then she went on, and after she had gone a
while, she came to a little hut that lay all by itself
in the forest, near the king&rsquo;s castle. She went in
and asked whether she might not stay there. Now
the little hut belonged to an old woman, and she
was an arrant and evil witch; at first she did not
want to take in the Master Girl at all; but at last
she agreed to do so for love of money. But the
whole hut was as dark and dirty as a pig-sty; therefore
the Master Girl said she would clean up a bit,
so that things would look as they did in other, decent
people&rsquo;s houses. The old woman would have none
of it, and was very disagreeable and angry; but the
Master Girl paid no attention to her. She took the
chest of gold dust, and threw a handful into the
fire, so that a ray of gold shone over the whole hut,
and it was gilded outside and in. But when the gold
flamed up, the old woman was so terribly frightened
that she ran out as though the evil one were after
her, and from pure rage she forgot to duck at the
threshold, and ran her head against the door-post.
And that was the end of her.</p>

<p>The following morning the bailiff came by. He
was much surprised to see the little golden hut, glittering
and sparkling there in the forest, and was
still more surprised at the girl within the hut. He
fell in love with her at once, and asked her whether
she would not become the bailiff&rsquo;s lady. &ldquo;Yes, but
have you plenty of money?&rdquo; said the Master Girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Yes, he had quite a little, said the bailiff. Then he
went home to fetch his money, and came back again
at evening dragging along an enormous sack of it,
which he stood on a bench before the door. The
Master Girl said that, seeing he had so much money,
she would accept him. And then she asked him to
rake the fire, which she said she had forgotten to
do. But as soon as he had the poker in his hand,
the Master Girl cried: &ldquo;May God grant that you
hold the poker, and the poker hold you, and that
sparks and ashes fly around you until morning!&rdquo;
And there the bailiff stood the whole night through,
and sparks and ashes flew about him, nor were the
sparks the less hot for all his complaining and begging.
And when morning came, and he could let go
the poker, he did not stay long; but ran off as though
the evil one were at his heels. And those who saw
him stared and laughed, for he ran like a madman,
and looked as though he had been thrashed and
tanned. And all would have liked to have known
where he had come from, but he said not a word, for
he was ashamed.</p>

<p>On the following day the clerk passed by the
Master Girl&rsquo;s little house. He saw it glistening and
shining in the woods, and went in to find out who
lived there. When he saw the beautiful girl he fell
even more deeply in love with her than the bailiff
had, and lost no time in suing for her hand. The
Master Girl asked him, as she had asked the bailiff,
whether he had plenty of money. Money he had to
spare, answered the clerk, and ran right home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
fetch it. By evening he was back again with a great
sack&mdash;it must have been as much again as the bailiff
had brought&mdash;and stood it on the bench. And so
she promised to take him. Then she asked him to
shut the house-door, which she said she had forgotten
to do. But when he had the door-knob in his
hand, she cried: &ldquo;May God grant that you hold the
door-knob and that the door-knob hold you, and that
you move back and forth with it all night long until
morning!&rdquo; And the clerk had to dance the whole
night through, such a waltz as he had never tripped
before, and he had no wish to repeat the experience.
Sometimes he was ahead, and sometimes the door
was, and so they went back and forth all night, from
wall to post and post to wall, and he was nearly
bruised to death. First he cursed, then he wailed
and pleaded; but the door paid no attention to him,
and flung open and shut until it dawned. When it
at last released him, he hurried away as quickly as
though he had stolen something, forgot his sackful
of money, and his wish to marry, and was glad that
the door did not come threshing along after him.
All grinned and stared at the clerk, for he ran
like a madman, and looked worse than if a ram had
been butting him all night long.</p>

<p>On the third day the magistrate came by, and also
saw the little golden house in the forest. And he,
too, went in to see who lived in it. And when he
saw the Master Girl, he fell so deeply in love with
her that he sued for her hand as soon as he bade
her good-day. But she told him just what she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
told the others, that if he had plenty of money she
would take him. He had money enough, said the
magistrate, and he went straight home to fetch it.
When he came back in the evening, he had a much
bigger sack of money with him than the clerk had
had, and he stood it on the bench. Then the Master
Girl said she would take him. But first she asked
him to go fetch the calf, which she had forgotten
to bring to the stable. And when he had the calf
by the tail she cried: &ldquo;May God grant that you hold
the calf&rsquo;s tail, and the calf&rsquo;s tail hold you, and that
you fly about the world together until morning!&rdquo;
And with that the race began, over stick and stone,
over hill and dale, and the more the magistrate
cursed and yelled, the more madly the calf ran
away. When it dawned there was hardly a whole
bone in the magistrate&rsquo;s body, and he was so happy
to be able to let go the calf&rsquo;s tail that he forgot his
bag of money, and the whole occurrence. It is true
that he went home more slowly than the bailiff and
the clerk; but the slower he went the more time
the people had to stare and grin at him, so ragged
and badly beaten did he appear after his dance with
the calf.</p>

<p>On the following day there was to be a wedding
at the castle, and not only was the older prince to
marry, but the one who had stayed with the giant as
well, and he was to get the other bride&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>But when they entered the coach and were about
to drive to church, one of the axles broke. They
took another, and then a third, but all of them broke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
no matter what kind of wood they used. It took a
great deal of time, and they did not move from the
spot, and got all out of sorts. Then the bailiff said,
for he had also been invited to the wedding at the
castle, that a maiden lived out in the forest, and &ldquo;if
they could only get the loan of her poker, it would
be sure to hold.&rdquo; So they sent to the little house
in the forest, and asked most politely whether the
maiden would not loan them the poker of which the
bailiff had spoken. And they got it, too, and then
they had an axle that would not break.</p>

<p>But when they wanted to drive on, the bottom of
the coach broke. They made a new bottom as well
as they were able, but no matter how they put it
together, nor what kind of wood they used, it kept
on breaking again as soon as they had left the court-yard.
And they were worse off than they had been
with the axle. Then the clerk said&mdash;for if the bailiff
was one of the company, you may be sure they had
not forgotten to invite the clerk&mdash;&ldquo;Out in the forest
lives a maiden, and if you will get the loan of her
house-door, I am sure it would not break.&rdquo; So they
sent to the little house in the forest, and asked most
politely whether the maiden would not loan them
the golden house-door, of which the clerk had told
them. And they got it, too, and were about to drive
on, when suddenly the horses could not draw the
coach. There were six, so they put to eight, and
then ten and twelve, but though they put as many
as they liked to the coach and helped along with the
whip, still the coach would not budge. The day was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
already far advanced, and they simply had to get
to church, and actually began to despair. But then
the magistrate said that out in the golden house in
the forest lived a maiden, &ldquo;and if one could only
get the loan of her calf, it would be sure to pull the
coach, and though it were as heavy as a bowlder.&rdquo;
They did not think it quite the thing to drive to
church with a calf; but still there was nothing to do
but to send to the maiden, and to ask her most politely,
with a kind greeting from the king, if she
would loan them the calf of which the magistrate
had spoken. Nor did the Master Girl refuse them
this time. And then, when they had put the calf to
the coach, it moved from the spot quickly enough.
It flew over stick and stone, hill and dale, so that the
people inside could hardly catch their breath. First
it was on the ground, and next it was in the air, and
when they reached the church, it spun around it like
a top, and they had the greatest difficulty in getting
out and into the church. And going home they went
still faster, and were nearly out of their wits by the
time they reached the castle.</p>

<p>When they sat down to the table the king&rsquo;s son&mdash;the
same who had been at the giant&rsquo;s&mdash;said it
would be no more than right to invite the maiden,
too, who had lent them the poker, and the door and
the calf: &ldquo;for if we had not had these things, we
should not have moved from the spot.&rdquo; This seemed
right to the king, so he sent five of his most distinguished
courtiers to the little golden house. They
were to carry the king&rsquo;s kindest greetings, and ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that the maiden come up to the castle and take dinner
with them. &ldquo;A kind greeting to the king, and if
he is too good to come to me, then I am too good to
go to him,&rdquo; said the Master Girl. So the king had
to go to her himself, and then she went along with
him at once, and the king saw very well that she
was more than she appeared to be, and gave her a
place at the head of the table, next to the young
bridegroom. After they had been at dinner for a
while, the Master Girl produced the rooster and the
hen and the golden apple&mdash;they were the three things
she had taken along from the giant&rsquo;s castle&mdash;and
placed them on the table before her. At once the
rooster and the hen began to fight for the golden
apple. &ldquo;Why, just see how the two fight for the
golden apple!&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Yes, that is
how we had to fight the time we wanted to get out
of the rock!&rdquo; said the Master Girl. And then the
king&rsquo;s son recognized her, and was very happy. The
witch who had rolled the apple over to him was duly
punished, and then the wedding really began, and
the bailiff, and the clerk and the magistrate held out
to the very end, for all that their wings had been so
thoroughly singed.</p>

<p class="center">NOTE</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Master Girl&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E., p.&nbsp;222. No.&nbsp;46)
is fitted out with a great wealth of interesting incident. The dream
motive of not being able to get away is most delightfully woven into
the context of the story, and the sea-sucker, whom the giant fetches
to stop the flight of the lovers, is a unique creation of fancy.</p>

<h2>XVI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ANENT THE GIANT WHO DID NOT HAVE HIS
HEART ABOUT HIM</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a king who had
seven sons, and he was so fond of them that
he never could bear to have them all away from him
at once, and one of them always had to stay with
him. When they had grown up, six of them were to
go forth and look for wives; but the youngest the
king wanted to keep at home, and the others were
to bring along a bride for him. The king gave the
six the handsomest clothes that had ever been seen,
clothes that glittered from afar, and each received
a horse that had cost many hundred dollars, and so
they set forth. And after they had been at the courts
of many kings, and had seen many princesses, they
at last came to a king who had six daughters. Such
beautiful princesses they had not as yet met with,
and so each of them paid court to one of them, and
when each had won his sweetheart, they rode back
home again. But they were so deeply in love with
their brides that they altogether forgot they were
also to bring back a princess for their young brother
who had stayed at home.</p>

<p>Now when they had already covered a good bit
of the homeward road, they passed close to a steep
cliff-side where the giants dwelt. And a giant came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
out, looked at them, and turned them all to stone,
princes and princesses. The king waited and waited
for his six sons; but though he waited and yearned,
they did not come. Then he grew very sad, and said
that he would never really be happy again. &ldquo;If I
did not have you,&rdquo; he told his youngest, &ldquo;I would
not keep on living, so sad am I at having lost your
brothers.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I had already been thinking of
asking your permission to set out and find my brothers
again,&rdquo; said the youngest. &ldquo;No, that I will not
allow under any circumstances,&rdquo; answered the
father, &ldquo;otherwise you will be lost to me into the
bargain.&rdquo; But the youth&rsquo;s mind was set on going,
and he pleaded so long that finally the king had to
let him have his way. Now the king had only a
wretched old nag for him, since the six other princes
and their suite had been given all the good horses;
but that did not worry the youngest. He mounted
the shabby old nag, and &ldquo;Farewell, father!&rdquo; he said
to the king. &ldquo;I will surely return, and perhaps I
will bring my six brothers back with me.&rdquo; And with
that he rode off.</p>

<p>Now when he had ridden a while he met a raven,
who was lying in the road beating his wings, and
unable to move from the spot because he was so
starved. &ldquo;O, dear friend, if you will give me a bite
to eat, then I&rsquo;ll help you in your hour of direst
need!&rdquo; cried the raven. &ldquo;I have not much food,
nor are you likely to be able to help me much,&rdquo; said
the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;but still I can give you a little, for
it is easy to see you need it.&rdquo; And with that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
gave the raven some of the provisions he had with
him. And when he had ridden a while longer, he
came to a brook, and there lay a great salmon who
had gotten on dry land, and was threshing about,
and could not get back into the water. &ldquo;O, dear
friend, help me back into the water,&rdquo; said the salmon
to the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;and I will help you, too, in your
hour of greatest need!&rdquo; &ldquo;The help you will be able
to give me will probably not amount to much,&rdquo; said
the prince, &ldquo;but it would be a pity if you had to lie
there and pine away.&rdquo; And with that he pushed the
fish back into the water. Then he rode on a long,
long way, and met a wolf; and the wolf was so
starved that he lay in the middle of the road, and
writhed with hunger. &ldquo;Dear friend, let me eat your
horse,&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;My hunger is so great that
my very inwards rattle, because I have had nothing
to eat for the past two years!&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the
prince, &ldquo;I cannot do that: first I met a raven, and
had to give him my provisions; then I met a salmon
and had to help him back into the water; and now
you want my horse. That will not do, for what shall
I ride on then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, my dear friend, you must
help me,&rdquo; was the wolf&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;You can ride on
me. I will help you in turn in your hour of greatest
need.&rdquo; &ldquo;The help you might give me would
probably not amount to much; but I will let you eat
the horse, since you are in such sorry case,&rdquo; returned
the prince. And when the wolf had eaten
the horse, the prince took the bit and put it in the
wolf&rsquo;s mouth, and fastened the saddle on his back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and his meal had made the wolf so strong that he
trotted off with the king&rsquo;s son as fast as he could.
He had never ridden so swiftly before. &ldquo;When we
have gone a little further I will show you the place
where the giants live,&rdquo; said the wolf; and in a short
time they were there. &ldquo;Well, this is where the
giants live,&rdquo; said the wolf. &ldquo;There you see your
six brothers, whom the giant turned into stone, and
yonder are their six brides; and up there is the door
through which you must pass.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I would not
dare do that,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;He would
murder me.&rdquo; &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; was the wolf&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;when
you go in you will find a princess, and she will tell
you how to set about getting rid of the giant. You
need only do as she says.&rdquo; And the prince went
in, though he was afraid. When he entered the
house the giant was not there; but in one of the
rooms sat a princess, just as the wolf had said, and
such a beautiful maiden the youth had never seen.
&ldquo;Now may God help you, how did you get in here?&rdquo;
cried the princess, when she saw him. &ldquo;It is certain
death for you. No one can kill the giant who lives
here, for he hasn&rsquo;t his heart about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, since I do happen to be here, I will at least
make the attempt,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;And I want
to try to deliver my brothers, who stand outside,
turned to stone, and I would like to save you as
well.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, if you insist upon it, we must see
what we can do,&rdquo; replied the princess. &ldquo;Now you
must crawl under the bed here, and must listen carefully
when I talk to the giant. But you must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
make a sound.&rdquo; The prince slipped under the bed,
and no sooner was he there than the giant came
home. &ldquo;Hu, it smells like the flesh of a Christian
here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;a jackdaw
flew by with a human bone, and let it fall down
the chimney. I threw it out again at once, but the
odor does not disappear so quickly.&rdquo; Then the giant
said no more about it. Toward evening he went to
bed, but after he had lain there a while, the princess,
who sat looking out of the window, said: &ldquo;There is
something I would have asked you about long ago,
if only I had dared.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what may that be?&rdquo;
inquired the giant. &ldquo;I would like to know where
you keep your heart, since you do not have it about
you?&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;O, that is something you
need not ask about; at any rate, it lies under the
threshold of the door,&rdquo; was the giant&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; thought the prince under the bed, &ldquo;that is
where we will find it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the giant got up very early, and
went into the forest, and no sooner had he gone than
the prince and the king&rsquo;s daughter set about looking
for the heart under the threshold of the door. Yet no
matter how much they dug and searched&mdash;they found
nothing. &ldquo;This time he has fooled us,&rdquo; said the
princess. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try again.&rdquo; And she
picked the loveliest flowers she could find and
strewed them over the threshold&mdash;which they had
put to rights again&mdash;and when the time drew near
for the giant&rsquo;s return, the king&rsquo;s son crept under the
bed once more. When he was beneath it, the giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
came. &ldquo;Hu hu, I smell human flesh!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;A jackdaw flew by with
a human bone in her beak, and she let it fall down
the chimney. I threw it out at once, but I suppose
one can still smell it.&rdquo; Then the giant held his
tongue, and said no more about it. After a time he
asked who had strewn the flowers over the threshold.
&ldquo;O, I did that,&rdquo; said the princess. &ldquo;What does it
mean?&rdquo; the giant then asked. &ldquo;O, I am so fond of
you that I had to do it, because I know that is where
your heart lies.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said the giant,
&ldquo;but it does not happen to lie there at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had gone to bed, the princess sat looking
out of the window, and again asked the giant where
he kept his heart, for she was so fond of him, said
she, that she wanted to know above all things. &ldquo;O,
it is in the wardrobe there by the wall,&rdquo; said the
giant. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; thought the king&rsquo;s son under the
bed, &ldquo;that is where we will find it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the giant got up early, and went
into the forest, and no sooner had he gone than the
prince and the king&rsquo;s daughter set about looking for
his heart in the wardrobe. Yet no matter how much
they looked, they did not find it. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said
the princess, &ldquo;we will have to try once more.&rdquo; Then
she adorned the wardrobe with flowers and wreaths,
and toward evening the king&rsquo;s youngest son again
crawled under the bed. Then the giant came: &ldquo;Hu
hu, it smells of human flesh here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the princess. &ldquo;A jackdaw just this moment
flew by with a human bone in her beak, and she let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
fall down the chimney. I threw it out again at once,
but it may be that you can still smell it.&rdquo; When the
giant heard this, he had nothing further to say about
it. But not long afterward he noticed that the wardrobe
was adorned with flowers and wreaths, and
asked who had done it. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said the princess.
&ldquo;What do you mean by such tomfoolery?&rdquo; asked the
giant. &ldquo;O, I am so fond of you that I had to do it,
since I know that is where your heart lies,&rdquo; was the
reply of the princess. &ldquo;Are you really so stupid as
to believe that?&rdquo; cried the giant. &ldquo;Yes, surely, I
must believe it,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;when you tell
me so.&rdquo; &ldquo;How silly you are,&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;you
could never reach the place where I keep my heart.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But still I would like to know where it is,&rdquo; answered
the princess. Then the giant could no longer
resist, and at last had to tell her the truth. &ldquo;Far,
far away, in a lake there lies an island,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and on the island stands a church, and in the
church there is a well, and in the well floats a duck,
and in the duck there is an egg, and in the egg&mdash;is
my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning, before dawn, the giant went to
the forest again. &ldquo;Well, now I must get under
way,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;and it is a way I wish I
could find.&rdquo; So he said farewell to the princess for
the time being, and when he stepped out of the door,
the wolf was standing there waiting for him. He
told him what had happened at the giant&rsquo;s, and said
that now he would go to the well in the church, if
only he knew the way. The wolf told him to climb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
on his back. He would manage to find the way, said
he. And then they were off as though they had
wings, over rock and wood, over hill and dale. After
they had been underway for many, many days, they
at last reached the lake. Then the king&rsquo;s son did
not know how they were to get across. But the wolf
told him not to worry, and swam across with the
prince to the island. Then they came to the church.
But the church-key hung high up in the tower, and
at first the king&rsquo;s son did not at all know how they
were to get it down. &ldquo;You must call the raven,&rdquo;
said the wolf, and that is what the king&rsquo;s son did.
And the raven came at once, and flew right down
with the key, and now the prince could enter the
church. Then, when he came to the well, there was
the duck, sure enough, swimming about as the giant
had said. He stood by the well and called the duck,
and at last he lured her near him, and seized her.
But at the moment he grasped her and lifted
her out of the water, she let the egg fall into the
well, and now the prince again did not know how he
was to get hold of it. &ldquo;Well, you must call the
salmon,&rdquo; said the wolf. That is what the king&rsquo;s son
did, and the salmon came at once, and brought up the
egg from the bottom of the well. Then the wolf told
him to squeeze the egg a little. And when the prince
squeezed, the giant cried out. &ldquo;Squeeze it again!&rdquo;
said the wolf, and when the prince did so, the giant
cried out far more dolefully, and fearfully and tearfully
begged for his life. He would do all the king&rsquo;s
son asked him to, said he, if only he would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
squeeze his heart in two. &ldquo;Tell him to give back
their original form to your six brothers, whom he
turned to stone, and to their brides, as well; and
that then you will spare his life,&rdquo; said the wolf,
and the prince did so. The troll at once agreed, and
changed the six brothers into princes, and their
brides into kings&rsquo; daughters. &ldquo;Now squash the
egg!&rdquo; cried the wolf. Then the prince squeezed the
egg in two, and the giant burst into pieces.</p>

</div>

<p>When the king&rsquo;s youngest son had put an end to
the giant in this way, he rode back on his wolf to the
giant&rsquo;s home; and there stood his six brothers as
much alive as ever they had been, together with,
their brides. Then the prince went into the hill to
get his own bride, and they all rode home together.
And great was the joy of the old king when his seven
sons all returned, each with his bride. &ldquo;But the
bride of my youngest is the most beautiful, after all,
and he shall sit with her at the head of the table!&rdquo;
said the king. And then they had a feast that lasted
for weeks, and if they have not stopped, they are
feasting to this very day.</p>

<p>The fairy-tale, &ldquo;The Giant Who Did Not Have His Heart About
Him&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E., p.&nbsp;171, No.&nbsp;36), is founded on
the very ancient belief of the corporealization of the soul, and its
existence without the body. It is a belief widely current among
primitive peoples, and Koschei the Deathless of Russian fairy-tale
resembles our giant, though in his case the egg which holds his soul
is shattered on the ground, whereupon he dies at once.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">THE THREE PRINCESSES IN WHITELAND</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a fisherman, who
lived near the king&rsquo;s castle, and caught fish
for the king&rsquo;s table. One day when he had gone
fishing, he could not catch a thing. Try as he might,
no matter how he baited or flung, not the tiniest fish
would bite; but when this had gone on for a while, a
head rose from the water and said: &ldquo;If you will give
me the first new thing that has come into your house,
you shall catch fish a-plenty!&rdquo; Then the man agreed
quickly, for he could think of no new thing that might
have come into the house. So he caught fish all day
long, and as many as he could wish for, as may well
be imagined. But when he got home, he found that
heaven had sent him a little son, the first new thing
to come into the house since he had made his promise.
And when he told his wife about it, she began
to weep and wail, and pray to God because of the vow
her husband had made. And the woman&rsquo;s grief was
reported at the castle, and when it came to the king&rsquo;s
ears, and he learned the reason, he promised to take
the boy and see if he could not save him. And so
the king took him and brought him up as though he
were his own son, until he was grown. Then one day
the boy asked whether he might not go out fishing
with his father, he wanted to so very much, said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The king would not hear of it; but at last he was
given permission, so he went to his father, and
everything went well all day long, until they came
home in the evening. Then the son found he had
forgotten his handkerchief, and went down to the
boat to get it. But no sooner was he in the boat
than it moved off with a rush, and no matter how
hard the youth worked against it with the oars, it
was all in vain. The boat drove on and on, all night
long, and at last he came to a white strand, far, far
away. He stepped ashore, and after he had gone a
while he met an old man with a great, white beard.
&ldquo;What is this country called?&rdquo; asked the youth.
&ldquo;Whiteland,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s answer, and he asked
the youth where he came from, and what he wanted,
and the latter told him. &ldquo;If you keep right on along
the shore,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you will come to three
princesses, buried in the earth so that only their
heads show. Then the first will call you&mdash;and she is
the oldest&mdash;and beg you very hard to come to her
and help her; and the next will do the same; but you
must go to neither of them; walk quickly past them,
and act as though you neither saw nor heard them.
But go up to the third, and do what she asks of you,
for then you will make your fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the youth came to the first princess, she
called out to him, and begged him most earnestly to
come to her; but he went on as though he had not
seen her. And he passed the next one in the same
manner; but went over to the third. &ldquo;If you will do
what I tell you to, you shall have whichever one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
us you want,&rdquo; said she. Yes, he would do what she
wanted. So she told him that three trolls had wished
them into the earth where they were; but that formerly
they had dwelt in the castle he saw on the
edge of the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you must go to the castle, and let the trolls
whip you one night through for each one of us,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;and if you can hold out, you will have delivered
us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the youth, he could manage
that. &ldquo;When you go in,&rdquo; added the princess, &ldquo;you
will find two lions standing by the door; but if you
pass directly between them, they will do you no
harm. Go on into a dark little room and lie down,
and then the troll will come and beat you; but after
that you must take the bottle that hangs on the wall,
and anoint yourself where he has beaten you, and
you will be whole again. And take the sword that
hangs beside the bottle, and kill the troll with it.&rdquo;
He did as the princess had told him, passed between
the lions as though he did not see them, and right
into the little room, where he lay down. The first
night a troll with three heads and three whips came,
and beat the youth badly; but he held out, and when
the troll had finished, he took the bottle and anointed
himself, grasped the sword and killed the troll.
When he came out in the morning the princesses
were out of the ground up to their waists. The next
night it was the same; but the troll who came this
time had six heads and six whips, and beat him
worse than the first one. But when he came out in
the morning, the princesses were out of the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
up to their ankles. The third night came a troll who
had nine heads and nine whips, and he beat and
whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted.
Then the troll took him and flung him against the
wall, and as he did so the bottle fell down, and its
whole contents poured over the youth, and he was
at once sound and whole again. Then he did not
delay, but grasped the sword, killed the troll, and
when he came out in the morning, the princesses
were entirely out of the ground. So he chose the
youngest of them to be his queen, and lived long with
her in peace and happiness.</p>

<p>But at last he was minded to travel home, and see
how his parents fared. This did not suit his queen;
but since he wanted to go so badly, and finally was
on the point of departure, she said to him: &ldquo;One
thing you must promise me, that you will only do
what your father tells you to do, but not what your
mother tells you to do.&rdquo; And this he promised.
Then she gave him a ring which had the power of
granting two wishes to the one who wore it. So he
wished himself home, and his parents could not get
over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome
he had become.</p>

<p>When he had been home a few days, his mother
wanted him to go up to the castle and show the
king what a man he had grown to be. His father
said: &ldquo;No, he had better not do that, for we will
have to do without him in the meantime.&rdquo; But
there was no help for it, the mother begged and
pleaded until he went. When he got there he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
more splendidly dressed and fitted out than the
other king. This did not suit the latter, and he
said: &ldquo;You can see what my queen looks like, but
I cannot see yours; and I do not believe yours is as
beautiful as mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;God grant she were standing
here, then you would see soon enough!&rdquo; said
the young king, and there she stood that very minute.
But she was very sad, and said to him: &ldquo;Why
did you not follow my advice and listen to your
father? Now I must go straight home, and you
have used up both of your wishes.&rdquo; With that she
bound a ring with her name on it in his hair, and
wished herself home.</p>

<p>Then the young king grew very sad, and went
about day in, day out, with no other thought than
getting back to his queen. &ldquo;I must try and see
whether I cannot find out where Whiteland is,&rdquo;
thought he, and wandered forth into the wide world.
After he had gone a while he came to a hill; and
there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts
of the forest&mdash;for they came when he blew his horn&mdash;and
him the king asked where Whiteland was.
&ldquo;That I do not know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I will ask my
beasts.&rdquo; Then he called them up with his horn, and
asked whether any of them knew where Whiteland
might be; but none of them knew anything about it.</p>

<p>Then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes. &ldquo;If
you stand in them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will come to my
brother, who lives a hundred miles further on. He
is the lord of the birds of the air. Ask him. When
you have found him, turn the snowshoes around so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that they point this way, and they will come back
home of their own accord.&rdquo; When the king got
there, he turned the snowshoes around, as the lord
of the beasts had told him, and they ran home again.
He asked about Whiteland, and the man called up
all the birds with his horn, and asked whether any
of them knew where Whiteland might be. But none
of them knew. Long after the rest an old eagle
came along; and he had been out for some ten years,
but did not know either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I will lend you a pair of
snowshoes. When you stand in them you will come
to my brother, who lives a hundred miles further on.
He is the lord of all the fishes in the sea. Ask him.
But do not forget to turn the snowshoes around
again.&rdquo; The king thanked him, stepped into the
snowshoes, and when he came to the one who was
lord of all the fishes in the sea, he turned them
around, and they ran back like the others. There
he once more asked about Whiteland.</p>

<p>The man called up his fishes with his horn, but
none of them knew anything about it. At last there
came an old, old carp, whom he had called with his
horn only at the cost of much trouble. When he
asked him, he said: &ldquo;Yes, I know it well, for I was
cook there for fully ten years. To-morrow I have
to go back again, because our queen, whose king has
not come home again, is going to marry some one
else.&rdquo; &ldquo;If such be the case,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give you a bit of advice. Out there by the wall
three brothers have been standing for the last hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
years, fighting with each other about a hat, a
cloak and a pair of boots. Any one who has these
three things can make himself invisible, and wish
himself away as far as ever he will. You might say
that you would test their possessions, and then decide
their quarrel for them.&rdquo; Then the king thanked
him, and did as he said. &ldquo;Why do you stand there
fighting till the end of time?&rdquo; said he to the brothers.
&ldquo;Let me test your possessions if I am to decide
your quarrel.&rdquo; That suited them; but when he had
hat, cloak and boots, he told them: &ldquo;I will give you
my decision the next time we meet!&rdquo; and with that
he wished himself far away. While he was flying
through the air he happened to meet the North
Wind. &ldquo;And where are you going?&rdquo; asked the North
Wind. &ldquo;To Whiteland,&rdquo; said the king, and then
he told him what had happened to him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said the North Wind, &ldquo;you are traveling a little
quicker than I am; for I must sweep and blow out
every corner. But when you come to your journey&rsquo;s
end, stand on the steps beside the door, and then
I&rsquo;ll come roaring up as though I were going to tear
down the whole castle. And when the prince who
is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what
it all means, I&rsquo;ll just take him along with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king did as the North Wind told him. He
stationed himself on the steps; and when the North
Wind came roaring and rushing up, and laid hold of
the castle walls till they fairly shook, the prince
came out to see what it was all about. But that
very moment the king seized him by the collar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
threw him out, and the North Wind took him and
carried him off. When he had borne him away, the
king went into the castle. At first the queen did not
recognize him, for he had grown thin and pale because
he had wandered so long in his great distress;
but when he showed her the ring, she grew glad at
heart, and then they had a wedding which was such
a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Three Princesses in Whiteland&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen and Moe,

who could not hold his tongue.</p>

<h2>XVIII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">TROUBLE AND CARE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Far,</span> far from here there once lived a king, who
had three beautiful daughters. But he had no
sons, and therefore he grew so fond of the three
princesses that he granted their every wish. But
in time the enemy invaded the country, and the king
had to go to war. When he set out, the oldest princess
begged him to buy her a ring that would prevent
her dying as long as she wore it. The second
princess asked him for a wreath that would make
her happy whenever she looked at it, no matter how
sad and troubled her heart might be. &ldquo;Buy me
trouble and care!&rdquo; said the youngest. And the king
promised everything.</p>

<p>When he had driven the enemy out of his own
land, and out of the neighboring land as well, and
was about to set out for home, he remembered what
he had promised the three princesses. The ring and
the wreath were easy enough to obtain; but trouble
and care were to be had neither in one place nor in
another, for all the people were so happy that the
enemy had been driven out, that there was no sorrow
nor care to be found in the entire kingdom. And
since he could not buy it, it was not to be had at all,
and he had to travel home without it, loathe as he
was to do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was not far from the castle, his way
took him through a thick forest. And there sat a
squirrel in a tree by the road. &ldquo;Buy me! buy me!
My name is trouble and care!&rdquo; it said. Thought
the king to himself, It is better to have a squirrel
than two empty hands, so he brought it along for
his youngest daughter. And she was quite as well
pleased with her present as her two sisters were
with the ring and the wreath. The squirrel played
about in her room, sometimes it balanced itself on
the bed-posts, at others it would sit on the top of
the wardrobe, and it always had a great deal to
chatter about.</p>

<p>But as soon as it grew dark, it turned into a man.
And he told her how an evil and malicious giantess
dwelt in the golden forest, who had turned him into
a squirrel because he would not marry her. During
the night she had no power over him; but every
morning at daybreak he had to slip back into his
squirrel form.</p>

<p>And in the course of time the princess actually
wanted to marry Trouble and Care; but when they
were betrothed, he begged her earnestly, and as best
he knew how, never to light a light at night, and try
to look at him, &ldquo;for then both of us would be unhappy,&rdquo;
said he. No, said she, she would be quite
sure not to do so.</p>

<p>And every evening, when the princess had lain
down and blown out the light, she would hear a man
go into Trouble and Care&rsquo;s room; but when morning
dawned, the squirrel sat on her bed-post and greeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
her, and chattered and babbled about all sorts of
things.</p>

<p>Once, when she thought Trouble and Care had
gone to sleep, she could not help herself; but stood
up quietly, lit a light and crept softly into his room
and to his bed, and when the ray of light fell on him,
she saw that he was far, far handsomer than the
most handsome prince. He was so surpassingly
handsome that she bent over him in order to see
more clearly, and finally she could not help herself,
but had to kiss him. And then, three drops of wax
from the candle fell on his chest, and he awoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could you have done this!&rdquo; he cried, and
was quite unhappy. &ldquo;Had you only waited three
days longer, I should have been free!&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;But now I must return to the evil giantess and
marry her, and all is over between us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can I
not follow you there?&rdquo; asked the princess. &ldquo;No,
that is something you could not do in all your days,
for if you rest or even so much as bend your knees
to sit down, you will go back during the night as
far as you came forward during the day,&rdquo; said he;
leaped to the door, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then the princess wept and wailed, and waited
for him to return; but she heard and saw nothing
more of him. After a few days she grew so restless
and wretched that she could no longer remain
at home, and implored her maid to go along with her
to search for the golden forest. The girl finally allowed
herself to be moved; but she would not agree
to set out until she had gotten together a yard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
drilling, a yard of ticking, and a yard of fine linen;
and she got them at once, as you may imagine, for
there was no shortage of such things in the castle.</p>

<p>So they set out and wandered far, and ever farther,
until their feet ached, and their spirits fell.
Toward evening they came into the middle of a
thick, dark forest; and climbed up into a high
tree. The princess was so tired that the maid had
to hold her in her arms while she slept a little.
But during the night the ground about the tree grew
alive with wolves, in the most sinister fashion, and
they howled and cried, so that the princess did not
venture to close her eyes another moment. But
when daylight appeared in the skies, it seemed as
though the wolves had suddenly all been blown
away.</p>

<p>The following day they wandered far and ever
farther, until their feet ached more, and their spirits
sank lower. Toward evening they again came to the
middle of a thick, dark forest. And they once more
climbed into a high, high tree; but the princess was
so tired that the maid had to hold her in her arms
while she slept a little. When it grew darker, a most
alarming number of bears flocked together under
the tree, and began to dance and turn in a circle, with
alarming speed, and all at once they tried to climb
the tree. So the princess and her maid had to stand
up in the tree-top the whole night through, and could
not close an eye; but when day came, it seemed as
though the bears sank into the earth in a single
moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The third day they wandered far and ever farther,
and then a bit more. Toward evening they
again came to a thick, dark forest. There they again
climbed into a high, high tree; but no sooner were
they up in the tree than the ground beneath the
tree and the whole forest were alive with lions, and
they all roared and howled together in such a gruesome
way that the echoes came back from rock and
woodland. Suddenly they began to dance and whirl
around in such a terrible fashion that the earth
trembled, and in between they would clutch the tree
again, and try to shake and loosen it, as though they
would pull it out root and branch. The princess and
her maid had to stand up in the very tree-top, and
though they were so tired they could have fallen
down from time to time, neither of them dared think
of sleeping. But the moment day dawned, the lions
all suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth,
where they were, walking and standing.</p>

<p>Then they stumbled along, this way and that, the
whole day long, until their feet ached harder than
hard, and their spirits sank lower than low. They
lost path and direction, and though they hunted
north and south and east and west, they could not
find the way out of the great, dark forest.</p>

<p>At last the princess grew tired and sad beyond
all measure, and wanted to sit down every moment,
in order to rest a little; but the maid held her and
dragged her forward, and never let her bend her
knees for a moment to sit down, because then they
would have gone back just as far as they had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
that day; for you must know that the giantess in
the golden forest had so arranged matters.</p>

<p>In the evening they came to an enormous, horrible
rock. &ldquo;I will knock here,&rdquo; said the maid, and tapped
and knocked. &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;please
don&rsquo;t knock here, you can see how ugly everything is
here!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is knocking there at my door?&rdquo; cried
the giantess in the rock, in a loud, harsh manner,
opened the door, and stuck her nose&mdash;it was all of a
yard long&mdash;out through the crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The youngest princess and her maid, they want
to get to a prince in the golden forest, whose name is
Trouble and Care,&rdquo; was the maid&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, faugh!&rdquo; cried the giantess, &ldquo;that is so far to
the north that one can neither sail nor row there.
But what do you want of Trouble and Care? Is
this, perhaps, the princess who wanted to marry
him?&rdquo; asked the giantess. Yes, this was the princess.
&ldquo;Well, she will never get him as long as she
lives,&rdquo; said the giantess, &ldquo;for now he must marry
the great giantess in the golden forest. You might
just as well go back home now as later,&rdquo; said she.
No, they would not turn back for anything, and the
maid asked whether it would not be possible for her
to take them in for the darkest part of the night.
&ldquo;I can take you in easily enough,&rdquo; said the giantess,
&ldquo;but when my husband comes home he will tear off
your heads, and eat you up!&rdquo; But there was no
help for it, they could not go on in the middle of the
night. Then the maid pulled out the yard of ticking,
and gave it to the giantess for linen. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be true! It can&rsquo;t be true!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Here I have
been married all of a hundred years, and have never
yet had any ticking!&rdquo; And she was so pleased that
she invited the wanderers in, received them kindly,
and took the best care of them. After a while, when
they had strengthened themselves with food and
drink, the giantess said to them: &ldquo;Yes, he is a ferocious
fellow, is my husband, and I will have to hide
you in the anteroom. Perhaps he will not find you
then.&rdquo; And she prepared a bed for them, as soft
and comfortable as a bed can be; but they did not
care to lie down in it, nor sit in it; no, they could not
even close their eyes, for they had to watch to see
that their knees did not bend. So they stood the
whole night through, and took turns holding each
other up, for by now the maid was so weary and
wretched that she was ready to give in.</p>

<p>Toward midnight it began to thunder and rumble
in a terrible manner. This was the troll coming
home; and no sooner had he thrust his first head in
at the door than he cried out loudly and harshly:
&ldquo;Faugh! faugh! I smell Christian bodies!&rdquo; and he
rushed about in so wild and furious a manner that
the sparks flew. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the giantess, &ldquo;a bird
flew past with a bone from a Christian, and he let it
drop down the chimney. I threw it out again as
quickly as I could, but perhaps one can smell it
still,&rdquo; said the giantess, and soothed him again.
And he was satisfied with her explanation. But the
next morning the giantess told him that the youngest
princess and her maid had come in search of a prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
named Trouble and Care, in the golden forest. &ldquo;O
faugh! that is so far to the north that one can
neither sail nor row there!&rdquo; the troll at once cried.
&ldquo;It is the princess who wanted to marry him, I
know, but she will never get him as long as she
lives, for he has to marry the great giantess in three
days&rsquo; time. But the maidens shall not get away from
me! Where are they, where are they?&rdquo; he cried,
and sniffed and snuffed about in every corner. &ldquo;O
no, you must not touch them,&rdquo; said the giantess.
&ldquo;They have given me a yard of ticking, and here I
have been married now for more than a hundred
years, and have never owned any ticking. Therefore
you must lend them your seven-mile waistcoat
to the nearest neighbor,&rdquo; said the giantess, and
pleaded for the girls. And the troll was willing
when he heard how kind they had been to his wife.</p>

<p>When they had eaten and were ready to travel,
he put his seven-mile waistcoat on them: &ldquo;And now
you must repeat: &lsquo;Forward over willow bush and
pine-tree, over hill and dale, to the nearest neighbor,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;And when you get there you must
say: &lsquo;You are to be hung up this evening where you
were put on this morning!&rsquo;&rdquo; The maidens did as
he said, and were carried for miles, over hill and
dale. In the evening, at dusk, they again came to a
great, ugly rock. There they pulled off the seven-mile
waistcoat and said: &ldquo;You are to be hung up
this evening where you were put on this morning,&rdquo;
and then the waistcoat ran home by itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will knock here,&rdquo; said the maid, and knocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and thumped on the rock. &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said the princess,
&ldquo;please do not knock here. You can see how
sinister everything is here!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is thumping
at my door?&rdquo; cried the giantess inside the rock,
more loudly and harshly than the first one, and she
opened the door and thrust her nose, that was all
of two yards long, right through the crack. &ldquo;Here
stand the youngest princess and her maid, and they
are looking for a prince named Trouble and Care,
who lives in the golden forest,&rdquo; answered the maid.
And then this giantess also said it was so far north
that one could neither sail nor row there, and wanted
them to turn back by all means. &ldquo;You might just
as well turn back now as later,&rdquo; said she. But this
the maidens did not want to do at all, and the maid
asked whether she would not, perhaps, take them in
for the night, and if it were only the darkest part of
the night. &ldquo;Yes, I can take you in easily enough,&rdquo;
said the giantess, &ldquo;but when my husband comes
home to-night, he will tear off your heads and eat
you up!&rdquo; Then the maid pulled out a yard of drilling,
and gave it to the giantess for linen. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
be true! It can&rsquo;t be true! here I have been married
now for over two hundred years, and I have
never yet had any drilling in the house,&rdquo; cried the
giantess, and she was so pleased that she invited
them in, and received them kindly, and saw that they
wanted for nothing. After a while, when they had
strengthened themselves with food and drink, the
giantess said: &ldquo;Yes, he is a ferocious fellow, is my
husband, and he eats up every Christian who comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
here, root and branch. I&rsquo;ll have to put you in the
anteroom, perhaps he will not find you there,&rdquo; and
she prepared a bed for the maidens. But they did
not dare either to lie down nor sit on it, not for a
single moment, for they had to watch to see that
they did not bend their knees. So they stood there
the whole night through, and took turns holding each
other up, while each snatched a little sleep.</p>

<p>Toward midnight it began to rumble and thunder
in such a terrible manner that they could feel the
earth tremble beneath them. Then the troll came
rushing in. &ldquo;Faugh! faugh! I smell Christian bodies!&rdquo;
he cried out loudly and harshly, and thrashed
about in such a furious way that the sparks flew
from him as from a fire. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the giantess,
&ldquo;a bird flew by, and let a bone from a Christian fall
through the chimney. I threw it out again as quickly
as I could, but it may well be the case that the
smell still lingers,&rdquo; said she, and quieted her husband.
And he was satisfied with her explanation.
But when he got up in the morning, she told him that
the youngest princess and her maid had come in
search of a prince named Trouble and Care, in the
golden forest. When the troll heard that, he also
said that it was so far north that one could neither
sail nor row there. &ldquo;That is the princess who
wanted to marry him. Yes, I know; but she will
never get him as long as she lives, for he must
marry the great giantess herself in two days&rsquo; time,&rdquo;
said the troll. &ldquo;And where are they, these maidens?
They shall not escape from me with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
lives!&rdquo; he shouted, and sniffed and snuffed about
everywhere. &ldquo;O no, you must not harm them!&rdquo;
said the giantess, and told him that they had given
her a yard of drilling for linen. &ldquo;Therefore you
must lend them your seven-mile waistcoat to the
nearest neighbor,&rdquo; said she. And he was willing
at once, when he heard how kind they had been to
his giantess. When they had eaten in the morning,
he put his seven-mile waistcoat on them. &ldquo;When
you reach your goal, you need only say: &lsquo;Where you
were put on this morning, there you are to hang
again to-night!&rsquo; and then the seven-mile waistcoat
will travel home by itself,&rdquo; said the troll. Then
they were carried for miles, over hill and dale, on
and on. In the evening, at dusk, they again came
to a great, ugly rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will knock here!&rdquo; said the maid, and knocked
and thumped on the rock. &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said the princess,
&ldquo;please do not knock here, you can see how
sinister everything looks here!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is thumping
at my door?&rdquo; the giantess cried inside the rock,
in a ruder and harsher manner than the other two
giantesses, and she opened the door just far enough
so that she could thrust her nose, which was all of
three yards long, through the crack. &ldquo;Here stand
the youngest princess and her maid, in search of a
prince named Trouble and Care, who lives in the
golden forest,&rdquo; was the maid&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;O faugh!&rdquo;
cried the giantess, &ldquo;that is so far to the north that
one can neither sail nor row there. But what do
you want of Trouble and Care? Is this, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the princess who wanted to marry him?&rdquo; asked the
giantess. Yes, this was the princess, was the maid&rsquo;s
reply. Then this giantess said in turn: &ldquo;He must
marry the great giantess in the golden forest, so you
might just as well turn back home now as later!&rdquo;
But this the maidens did not want to do at all, and
the maid asked whether, perhaps, she would not
take them in for the night, and if it were only for
the very darkest part of the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can take you in easily enough,&rdquo; said the
giantess, &ldquo;but when my husband comes home to-night
he will tear off your heads and eat you up!&rdquo;
But there was nothing else to do; they could not
travel on through the wood and wilderness, in the
very darkest part of the night. Then the maid
pulled out the yard of linen and made the giantess
a present of it. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true! It can&rsquo;t be
true!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Here I have been married now
for more than three hundred years, and have never
yet had a bit of linen!&rdquo; And she was so pleased
that she invited the maidens in, and received them
kindly, and let them want for nothing. &ldquo;He is a
ferocious fellow, is my husband, and he does away
with every Christian soul that strays here,&rdquo; she
said, when her guests had eaten. &ldquo;But I will hide
you in the anteroom. Perhaps he will not find you
there.&rdquo; Then she carefully made up a soft bed for
them, as fine as the finest in the world. But now
the princess was weary and wretched and sleepy beyond
all measure. She could no longer stand up at
all, and finally had to lie down and sleep a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and even though it were but a tiny little while. The
maid was also so weary and wretched that she fell
asleep standing, and fell over from time to time.
Yet she still managed to keep her wits about her to
the extent of seizing the princess, and holding her
up, so that she did not bend her knees. Toward
midnight it began to rumble and thunder so that the
whole house shook, and it seemed as though the
roof and walls would fall in. This was the great
troll, who was coming home. When he thrust his
first nose in at the door, he at once cried out in a
manner so wild and harsh that the like had never
been heard before: &ldquo;Faugh! faugh! I smell Christian
bodies!&rdquo; and he fell into a white rage, so that
sparks and flame flew from him. &ldquo;Yes, a bird flew
by, and let a bone from a Christian fall through
the chimney. I threw it out as quickly as ever I
could; but it may be that the smell still persists!&rdquo;
said the giantess, and tried to pacify her troll. And
he was satisfied with her explanation. But when he
awoke in the morning, she told him that the youngest
princess and her maid had come in search of a
prince named Trouble and Care, who lived in the
golden forest. &ldquo;O faugh! That is so far north
that one can neither sail nor row there!&rdquo; cried the
great troll, just as the smaller trolls had. &ldquo;But she
will never get him as long as she lives, for to-morrow
he must marry the great giantess. Where are
they, these maidens? Hm, hm, hm, they will make
tasty eating!&rdquo; he cried, and danced around everywhere,
and sniffed and snuffed with all his nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
noses at once. &ldquo;O no, you must not harm them!&rdquo;
cried the giantess. &ldquo;They have given me a yard
of linen, and here I have been married for more
than three hundred years, and have never had a bit
of linen yet. Therefore you must lend them your
seven-mile waistcoat to the nearest neighbor.&rdquo; And
when the super-troll heard that the maidens had
been so kind, he was agreeable.</p>

<p>When they had strengthened themselves in the
morning, he put his seven-mile waistcoat on them.
&ldquo;And now you must repeat: &lsquo;On, on! Over willow
brush and pine tree, over hill and dale, to the nearest
neighbor.&rsquo; And when you reach your goal, you
need only say: &lsquo;You must hang again to-night on
the nail from which you were taken down this morning!&rsquo;&rdquo;
said the great troll. They did as he had
told them, and were carried farther and farther
along, over hills and deep valleys.</p>

<p>At dusk they came to a large, large forest, where
all the trees were black as coal. If one only so much
as touched them, they made one look like a chimney-sweep.
And in the middle of the forest was a clearing,
and there stood a wretched hut, ready to fall
apart; it was only held together by two beams, and
looked more forlorn than the most wretched herdsman&rsquo;s
hut. And in front of the door lay a rubbish
heap of old shoes, dirty rags and other ugly stuff.
Here the maid took off the seven-mile waistcoat, and
said: &ldquo;You must hang again to-night from the nail
from which you were taken down this morning!&rdquo;
and the waistcoat wandered home all by itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will knock here!&rdquo; said the maid. &ldquo;O no, O
no,&rdquo; wailed the princess, &ldquo;please do not knock here,
you can see how ugly everything is!&rdquo; &ldquo;If you do
not do as I do, then it will be the worse for both
of us!&rdquo; said the maid; trampled through the rubbish-pile
and knocked. An old, old troll-woman with
a nose all of three yards long, looked out through the
crack in the door. &ldquo;If you girls want to come in,
then come in, and if you do not want to, you can stay
out!&rdquo; said she, and made as though to close the door
in their faces. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, we want to come in,&rdquo;
replied the maid, and drew the princess in with her.
&ldquo;If you girls want to come through the door, then
come through, but if you do not want to, you can
stay out,&rdquo; the woman said once more. &ldquo;Yes, thanks,
we want to come in,&rdquo; said the maid, and tramped
over the threshold through the dirt and rags.
&ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; wailed the princess, and tramped
after her. All was black and ugly inside, and as
grimy and dirty as a corn-loft. After a while the
giantess went out, and fetched them some milk to
drink. &ldquo;If you girls want to drink, why, drink, and
if you do not, why, do without!&rdquo; said she, and was
about to carry it out again. &ldquo;Yes, thanks, we want
to drink,&rdquo; said the maid, and drank. &ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo;
wailed the princess, when it came her turn, for the
milk was in a pig-trough, and dirt and clots of hair
were swimming in it. Then the giantess gave them
something to eat. &ldquo;If you girls want to eat, why,
eat, and if you do not, why, do without,&rdquo; said the
giantess. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, we will be glad to,&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
maid, before the ugly nosey could take the food away
again. The bread was moldly, mice had been nibbling
at the cheese, the meat was so old that one
could smell it at a distance, and two dirty calves&rsquo;
tails were draped about the butter. &ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo;
wailed the princess, and was ready to cry; but she
had to do what her maid did, and taste the horrible
dishes. Then they had to say they were much
obliged. An old man, whom thus far they had not
seen, lay on a bed covered with a few old odds and
ends of fur and other rags. When they went up to
him to thank him, he stood up, and when the princess
gave him her hand he kissed it; and at that very
moment he turned into a prince handsome beyond
all measure, and the princess saw that he was Trouble
and Care, for whom she had so greatly longed.
&ldquo;Now you have delivered me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Woe to
whoever has delivered you!&rdquo; cried the giantess, and
rushed out of the door; but on the door-step she
stood like a stone, for the forest was no longer black,
and all the trees looked as though they had been
gilded from root to crest, and glittered and sparkled
more brightly than the sun at noon-day. The
wretched, dirty hut had changed into a royal castle,
immensely large and handsome. One might have
thought that the roof and walls were made of the
purest gold and silver, and so they were. &ldquo;Now
you may bend your knee again,&rdquo; said the prince,
&ldquo;and if you have hitherto known nothing but sorrow
and care, you shall henceforth know all the more
happiness.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The old giantess had brewed and baked, and prepared
the whole wedding dinner. And when the next
day dawned, the prince and the princess, and all
the people in the castle, and in the whole country
over which he was king, celebrated the wedding.
And it lasted for four times fourteen days, so that
the news spread through seven kingdoms, and
reached the bride&rsquo;s father and her two sisters. And
they would have celebrated it with them, had they
not been so far away. I was invited to the feast
myself, and the bridegroom made me chief cook,
and I had to speak the toast for the bride and groom.
But on the last day of the feast, I had to draw mead
from a large, large cask that lay at the farthest end
of the cellar. Before I sent off the filled jug, I took
a taste myself, and the mead was so strong that it
suddenly went to my head, and I flew through the
air like a bird, and there I was, floating between
heaven and earth for full nine years, and then I
fell down here in the village, in front of the house
up there on the hill. And out came Bertha Friendly,
with a letter for me from the prince, who had become
king in the meantime, and the letter said that
he and the young queen were doing well, and that
they sent me their greetings, and that I was to greet
you for them, and that you and your sisters were
invited to the castle Sunday after Michaelmas, and
then you should see a pair of dear little princes, the
golden forest, and the old stone giantess, who stands
before the door with her nose three yards long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">NOTE</p>

<p>The story of Cupid and Psyche is the most celebrated representative
of the type of fairy-tale to which &ldquo;Trouble and Care&rdquo; belongs
(Hallv.&nbsp;E. Bergh, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Nye Folkeeventyr og Sagn fra Valdres og Hallindal</cite>,
Coll.&nbsp;III, Christiania, 1882, No.&nbsp;1). The northern peoples
take special pleasure in tales of faithful women, who try to reach
their vanished lovers by means of wearisome and difficult wanderings.
Peculiar is the transformation of the lover into a squirrel,
in this tale, and the condition that the poor princess must not
bend her knees, that is, sit or crouch down, during her long journey.
The end is a typical fairy-tale close, such as the narrator
likes to add, without any inner relationship to the story itself.</p>

<h2>XIX<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">KARI WOODENCOAT</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a king whose wife
had died, but he had a daughter who was so
good and so beautiful that no one could have been
kinder or lovelier than she. The king mourned a
long time for the queen, because he had loved her
greatly; but in the course of time he grew weary of
his lonely life, and married again with the widow
of another king, who also had a daughter; but one
who was just as ugly and evil as the other was
handsome and kind. The step-mother and daughter
were jealous of the king&rsquo;s daughter, because she
was so handsome; yet so long as the king was at
home, they did not dare harm her, for he was very
fond of her. But after a time, the king began to
war against another king, and went out to battle.
Then the queen thought she now could do as she
wished, and she let the king&rsquo;s daughter starve, and
beat and pushed her about everywhere. At last
everything else was too good for her, and she had
to herd the cows. So she went out with the cows,
and pastured them in the forest or on the hill.
Food she had little or none, and she grew pale and
thin, and was sad most of the time, and wept. In
the herd there was also a great blue bull, who always
kept himself neat and clean, and often came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
queen&rsquo;s daughter and let her scratch him. Once, as
she sat there and cried and was sad, he came to her
again, and asked why she was so unhappy. She did
not answer him but kept on weeping. &ldquo;Well, I
know what your trouble is,&rdquo; said the bull, &ldquo;even
though you will not tell me. You are weeping because
the queen is so unkind to you, and would
gladly starve you to death. But you need not worry
about food, for in my left ear is a cloth and, if you
will take it out and spread it, you can have as much
as you want to eat.&rdquo; She did so, took out the cloth,
laid it on the grass, and it was at once covered with
the finest dishes one might desire: bread and mead
and honey-cake. Then she soon regained her
strength, and grew so plump, and so rose and white
complexioned that the queen and her daughter, who
was as thin as a rail, turned green and yellow with
envy. The queen could not understand how it was
that her step-daughter came to look so well in spite
of such poor fare. So she told a maid to follow her
to the forest, and watch and see how it came about;
for she thought some of the servants secretly gave
her food. The maid followed her into the forest, and
watched carefully, and saw how the step-daughter
drew the cloth out of the blue bull&rsquo;s left ear, and
spread it out, and how it covered itself with the
finest dishes, and also how the king&rsquo;s daughter ate
heartily. And the maid told the queen at home
about it.</p>

<p>Now the king came home, and he had defeated the
other king, against whom he had warred; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
whole castle was overjoyed, and none was more joyful
than the king&rsquo;s daughter. But the queen pretended
to be ill, and gave the physician a great deal
of money so that he should say that she could not
recover unless she had some of the blue bull&rsquo;s flesh
to eat. The king&rsquo;s daughter and others as well
asked the physician whether nothing else would do,
and pleaded for the bull; for all liked him, and said
that there was not such another in the whole kingdom.
But no, he must be slaughtered, and he should
be slaughtered, and there was no help for it. When
the king&rsquo;s daughter heard this, she felt sad, and went
into the stable to the bull. He stood and hung his
head, and looked so mournful that she could not keep
from weeping. &ldquo;Why do you weep?&rdquo; asked the bull.
Then she told him that the king had come home, and
that the queen had pretended to be ill, and had forced
the physician to say that she could not recover unless
she had some of the blue bull&rsquo;s flesh to eat, and
that now he was to be slaughtered. &ldquo;Once she has
done away with me, it will not be long before she
does away with you,&rdquo; said the bull. &ldquo;But if it suits
you, we will run away from here to-night.&rdquo; The
king&rsquo;s daughter did say that it would be bad enough
to leave her father, but that at the same time it
would be worse to remain under the same roof with
the queen, and so she promised the bull to go with
him.</p>

<p>In the evening, while the rest were asleep, the
king&rsquo;s daughter crept down to the bull in the stable.
He took her on his back, and ran off as quickly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
ever he could. And when the people rose the following
morning, and wanted to slaughter the bull, he
was gone; and when the king rose and asked for his
daughter, she was gone as well. The king sent out
messengers on all sides, and had the church-bells
rung for her, but no one had seen anything of her.</p>

<p>In the meantime the bull trotted through many
lands with the king&rsquo;s daughter, and they came to a
great copper forest, whose trees, leaves and flowers
were all of copper. But before they entered it, the
bull said to the king&rsquo;s daughter: &ldquo;Now when we get
into the forest you must be very careful not to touch
so much as a single leaf, or else it is all up with you
and with me; for a troll with three heads lives here,
and the forest belongs to him.&rdquo; Yes, indeed, she
would be careful, and not touch anything. And she
was very careful, and leaned to one side, and thrust
aside the branches; but the forest was so thick that
it was almost impossible to win through, and for
all that she was so careful, she did tear off a leaf,
and it remained in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; cried the bull. &ldquo;What have you
done! Now I must fight for my very life. But see
that you keep the leaf carefully!&rdquo; Straightway they
reached the end of the forest, and at once a troll
with three heads came rushing up. &ldquo;Who has
touched my forest?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;The forest is as
much mine as yours!&rdquo; was the bull&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
see if it is!&rdquo; shouted the troll. &ldquo;That suits me!&rdquo;
cried the bull. Then they rushed at each other, and
the bull gored and butted with might and main. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the troll was just as strong, and it took all day before
the bull gained the upper hand. And then he had
so many wounds, and was so weak that he could
scarcely walk. So they had to halt for a whole day;
but the bull told the queen&rsquo;s daughter to take the
horn of ointment that hung at the troll&rsquo;s girdle, and
anoint him with the salve. Thereupon he grew
strong and well again, and they went on the next
day. Now they wandered for many, many days, and
at last came to a silver forest, whose trees, branches,
leaves, buds and all were of silver.</p>

<p>Before the bull entered the forest he said to the
king&rsquo;s daughter: &ldquo;Now when we get into this forest,
in heaven&rsquo;s name be careful! You must touch nothing,
and not even tear off so much as a single leaf,
or else it is all up with you and me. A troll with
six heads lives here, and the forest belongs to him,
and I will hardly be able to hold my own against
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;indeed I will
be careful, and not touch the least thing, just as you
have told me.&rdquo; But when they entered the forest,
it was so thick that it was almost impossible to win
through. She was as careful as she could be, and
avoided the branches, and thrust them aside with
her hands; but the branches struck her in the face
each moment, and in spite of all her care a leaf did
remain in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; cried the bull. &ldquo;What have you
done! Now I must fight for my very life, for the
troll with six heads is twice as strong as the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one; but see that you take care of the leaf and keep
it carefully!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once the troll came rushing up. &ldquo;Who has
touched my forest?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;The forest is as
much mine as yours!&rdquo; cried the bull. &ldquo;Oho, we&rsquo;ll
see if it is!&rdquo; cried the troll. &ldquo;That suits me!&rdquo; said
the bull, and rushed on the troll, gored him, and
thrust his horns right through him. But the troll
was just as strong, and it took three whole days
before the bull got the better of him. After that he
was so weak and feeble that he could scarcely move,
and so full of wounds that his blood ran in streams.
Then he told the king&rsquo;s daughter to take the horn
of ointment that hung at the troll&rsquo;s girdle, and
anoint him with the salve. She did so, and he recovered
again: yet they had to remain a time on
the spot, until he was once more able to go on.</p>

<p>At last they set out again; but the bull was still
weak, and at first they went slowly. The king&rsquo;s
daughter wanted to spare him, and said she was
young and quick on her feet, and could walk very
well; but this he would not allow, and she had to sit
on his back. Thus they wandered for a long time,
and through many lands, and the king&rsquo;s daughter
had no idea where they might be going; but at length
they came to a golden forest. It was very beautiful,
and the gold dripped down from it, for the trees,
and branches and leaves and buds were all of purest
gold. And here all went as it had in the copper
and silver forests. The bull told the king&rsquo;s daughter
that in no case was she to touch anything, since a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
troll with nine heads lived here, to whom the forest
belonged. And he was much larger and stronger
than the two others together, and he did not believe
he could hold his own against him. Yes, said she,
she would be sure to pay attention and positively
would not touch a thing. But when they entered
the forest, it was even thicker than the silver forest,
and the further they went the worse it became. The
forest grew thicker and denser, and at last it seemed
as though it would be impossible to push on at all.
She was much afraid of tearing off anything, and
wound and twisted and bent herself in every direction,
in order to avoid the branches, and thrust them
aside with her hands. But each moment they struck
her in the face, so that she could not see where she
was reaching, and before she had a chance to think,
she held a golden apple in her hand. Then she was
terribly frightened, and began to cry, and wanted
to throw it away. But the bull told her to keep it,
and hide it carefully, and consoled her as best he
could. Yet he thought that the battle would be a
hard one, and was in doubt as to whether it would
end well.</p>

<p>But now the troll with the nine heads came rushing
up, and he was so frightful that the king&rsquo;s daughter
could scarcely bear to look at him. &ldquo;Who has
touched my forest?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The forest is as
much mine as yours!&rdquo; cried the bull. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see
if it is!&rdquo; cried the troll. &ldquo;That suits me!&rdquo; said the
bull, and with this they rushed on each other, so
that it was a fearsome sight, and the king&rsquo;s daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
nearly fainted. The bull gored the troll through and
through with his horns; but the troll was as strong
as he, and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads,
the others breathed fresh life into it, and it took a
full week before the bull got the better of him. But
then he was so wretched and so weak that he could
not move a bit. His whole body was covered with
wounds; and he could not even tell the king&rsquo;s daughter
to take the horn of ointment from the troll&rsquo;s
girdle and anoint him with the salve. But she did
so of her own accord, and then he recovered again.
Yet they had to stay where they were for three whole
weeks, until he was able to go on again.</p>

<p>At last they once more went slowly on their way;
for the bull said they still had a little further to go,
and they went over many great hills and through
thick forests. After a time they came to a rock.
&ldquo;Do you see anything?&rdquo; asked the bull. &ldquo;No, I see
only the sky and the rock,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s daughter.
But when they went on up the hills were more level,
so that they had a broader outlook. &ldquo;Do you see
something now?&rdquo; asked the bull. &ldquo;Yes, I see a
small castle, far, far in the distance,&rdquo; said the princess.
&ldquo;And yet it is not so small,&rdquo; said the bull.
At length they came to a great mountain with a
steep, rocky face. &ldquo;Do you see something now?&rdquo;
asked the bull. &ldquo;Yes, now I see the castle close by,
and it is much, much larger,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s daughter.
&ldquo;That is where you must go!&rdquo; said the bull.
&ldquo;Just below the castle is a pig-sty, and if you go
into it you will find a wooden coat. You must put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
it on, and go with it into the castle, and say your
name is Kari Woodencoat, and ask for a place. But
now take your little knife and cut off my head; then
draw off my skin, roll it up and lay it at the foot
of the rock. But in it you must place the copper
leaf, and the silver leaf, and the golden apple. Outside,
against the hill, is a stick, and if you want
anything of me, all you need do is to knock at the
mountain-side.&rdquo; At first the princess could not at
all make up her mind to do this; but when the bull
told her that this was the only reward he wanted
for all the good he had done her, she could not refuse.
It made her heart ache, yet in spite of it, she
took her knife and cut until she had cut off the head
of the great beast, and had drawn off his skin, and
then she laid the latter at the foot of the rock, and
in it she placed the copper leaf, and the silver leaf,
and the golden apple.</p>

<p>When she had done this she went to the pig-sty,
but she wept a great deal and felt sad. Then she
put on the wooden coat, and went to the king&rsquo;s
castle in it. She asked for a place in the kitchen,
and said her name was Kari Woodencoat. Yes,
said the cook, she might have a place if she cared to
wash up, for the girl who had formerly attended to
it had run away. &ldquo;And after you have been here
a while, no doubt you will have enough of it, and run
away from us, too,&rdquo; said he. No, indeed, she would
not do so.</p>

<p>She was most industrious at her washing up. On
Sunday they expected company at the king&rsquo;s castle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and Kari asked permission to take up water to wash
in to the prince. But the others laughed at her and
cried; &ldquo;What do you want to do there? Do you
think the prince will have anything to do with you,
homely as you are?&rdquo; But she kept on asking, and
at length received permission.</p>

<p>And then, as she ran up the stairs, her wooden
coat clattered so loudly that the prince came out
and asked: &ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I came to bring
you water to wash in,&rdquo; said Kari. &ldquo;Do you think
I want the water you are bringing me?&rdquo; cried the
prince, and poured the water out over her head.
So she had to go off; but she asked permission to
go to church. And she received permission, for the
church was close by. But first she went to the rock
and knocked at it with a stick, as the bull had told
her. And a man came out at once and asked what
she wanted. The king&rsquo;s daughter said that she had
permission to go to church and hear the sermon, but
that she had no dress to wear. Then the man gave
her a dress that shone like the copper forest, and a
horse and a saddle as well. When she came to
church she looked so beautiful that all the people
wondered who she might be, and none of them listened
to the sermon, because they were all looking
at her. She even pleased the prince so much that
he could not keep from looking at her.</p>

<p>When she left the church, the prince came after
her, and closed the church door behind her, and kept
one of the gloves she wore in his hand. And then
when she wanted to mount her horse, the prince came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
again, and asked her where she came from. &ldquo;From
Washwaterland!&rdquo; said Kari, and while the prince
pulled out the glove and wanted to give it to her,
she said:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Be there light before me, and darkness behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the place I ride to the prince may not find!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The prince had never yet seen such a handsome
glove, and he traveled far, looking for the native
land of the noble lady who had abandoned her glove,
but no one could tell him where it might be.</p>

<p>The following Sunday some one had to go up to
the prince, and bring him a towel. &ldquo;Cannot I go
up?&rdquo; begged Kari. &ldquo;Is that all you want?&rdquo; said the
rest in the kitchen. &ldquo;You saw yourself what happened
to you the last time!&rdquo; But Kari kept on
asking, and finally she received permission, after
all, and ran up the stairs so that her wooden coat
fairly clattered. The prince at once thrust his head
out of the door, and when he saw that it was Kari,
he tore the towel out of her hand and flung it at her
head. &ldquo;Off with you, you horrid creature!&rdquo; cried
he. &ldquo;Do you think I want a towel that you have
touched with your dirty fingers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that the prince went to church, and Kari
also begged permission to go. The people asked her
why she wanted to go to church, since she had nothing
to wear but her ugly, black wooden coat. But
Kari said the pastor preached so beautifully that
she loved to listen to him, and finally they allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
her to go. She went to the wall of rock and knocked,
and the man came out and gave her a dress that was
far handsomer than the first; it was embroidered
all over with silver, and gleamed like the silver forest;
and she also received a splendid horse, with
housings embroidered with silver, and a silver bridle.
When the king&rsquo;s daughter came to the church, the
people were still standing before the church door.
In their astonishment they all asked each other who
she might be, and the prince came running up at
once, and wanted to hold her horse while she dismounted.
But she jumped right down, and said it
would not be necessary, since the horse was so tame
that it would stand still when she commanded, and
come to her if she wished. Then every one went
into the church. But hardly any one paid any attention
to the sermon; for they were all looking at
Kari, and the prince fell deeper in love with her
than he had the first time. When the sermon was
over, and she left the church and was about to mount
her horse, the prince again came, and asked where
she came from. &ldquo;From Towelland!&rdquo; said she, and
let fall her riding-whip. And when the prince
stooped to pick it up, she said:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Be there light before me, and darkness behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the place I ride to the prince may not find!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Off she was, and the prince did not know what had
become of her. He wandered about in the world,
far and wide, looking for her native land. But no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
one could tell him where it might be, and with that
the prince finally had to content himself.</p>

<p>The following Sunday some one was to go up to
the prince, and bring him a comb. Kari begged that
they would let her go, but the others reminded her
of what had happened the last time, and scolded her
for showing herself to the prince, ugly and black
as she was, and in her wooden coat. But she kept
on asking, and finally they let her go with the comb.
When she once more came clattering up the stairs,
the prince thrust his head out of the door, tore the
comb from her hand, and shouted at her to be off.
Then the prince went to church, and Kari wanted to
go as well. The rest again asked her why she wanted
to go to church, black and ugly as she was, since she
did not even have clothes fit to appear in before
other people. The prince, or some one else might
happen to see her, and that would mean unhappiness
for herself and others. But Kari said that the
people would have other things to look at besides
herself, and finally they let her go.</p>

<p>Then everything happened exactly as on the other
two occasions. She went to the wall of rock, and
knocked with the stick, and then the man came out,
and gave her a dress that was far more beautiful
than both of the others. It was all pure gold and diamonds,
and she also received a beautiful horse, with
housings embroidered with gold, and a golden bridle.</p>

<p>When the king&rsquo;s daughter came to the church, the
pastor and all the congregation were still standing
before the church door, waiting for her. The prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
came running up at once, and wanted to hold her
horse, but she jumped down and said: &ldquo;No, thanks,
it is not necessary, for my horse is so tame that he
will remain standing when I tell him to do so.&rdquo; So
they all went into the church, and the pastor mounted
the pulpit. But not a soul listened to the sermon,
because all the people were looking at the princess,
and wondering where she came from, and the prince
fell still more deeply in love than he had on the two
other occasions. He paid no attention to anything,
and looked only at her.</p>

<p>When the sermon was over, and the king&rsquo;s daughter
left the church, the prince had poured tar on the
floor of the vestibule, so that he might have a chance
to help the king&rsquo;s daughter across. But she paid
no attention to it, stepped right into the middle of
the tar, and leaped over. But one of her golden
shoes stuck fast, and when she had mounted her
horse, the prince came running out of the church
and asked her whence she came. &ldquo;From Combland!&rdquo;
she answered. But when the prince wanted
to hand her the golden shoe, she said:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Be there light before me, and darkness behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the place I ride to the prince may not find!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And again the prince did not know where she had
gone, and he wandered about the world a long time,
looking for Combland; but since no one could tell
him where it might be, he let it be known that he
would marry the girl whose foot the golden shoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
fitted. Then the handsome and the homely came
scurrying up from the ends of the earth; but none
of them had a foot so small that they could put on
the golden shoe. At last Kari&rsquo;s evil stepmother
and her daughter also came, and the shoe fitted the
latter. But she was very homely, and looked so unsatisfactory
that the prince kept his promise most
unwillingly. Notwithstanding, preparations were
made for the wedding, and she was adorned with
her bridal finery, but when they rode to church, a
little bird sat in a tree and sang:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;A bit of the heel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a bit of the toe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kari Woodencoat&rsquo;s shoe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is filled with blood, I know!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when they looked, the bird had told the truth,
for blood was dripping from the shoe. Then all the
maids and all the women who were at the castle had
to try on the shoe, but it would fit none of them.
&ldquo;But where is Kari Woodencoat?&rdquo; asked the prince,
for he had understood the song of the bird, and
remembered it well. &ldquo;O she!&rdquo; said the others. &ldquo;It
is not worth while having her come, for she has feet
like a horse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;But all the rest have tried it on, so she shall try
it on as well. Kari!&rdquo; he called out through the
door, and Kari came clattering up the stairs so that
everything shook, just as though a whole regiment
of dragoons had arrived. &ldquo;Now you shall try on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the golden shoe, and be a princess!&rdquo; said the others,
and made fun of her. But Kari took the shoe, put
her foot into it without a bit of trouble, cast off her
wooden coat, and stood there in her golden dress, so
that she was all a-sparkle, and on her other foot she
had the golden shoe&rsquo;s mate. The prince recognized
her at once, put his arm around her, and kissed her.
And she told him that she was a king&rsquo;s daughter,
which made him still more happy, and then they celebrated
their wedding.</p>

<p class="center">NOTE</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kari Woodencoat&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E., p.&nbsp;79, No.&nbsp;19)
proves how arbitrarily the motives of a fairy-tale are sometimes
handled. The blue bull helps the maiden out of her difficulties, and
we expect that he will turn out to be a handsome prince, or a
guardian spirit sent by the deceased mother. Instead of which he
disappears from the story with hardly a trace, and Kari marries
a foreign prince. The last part of the tale has an independent
existence in a Russian fairy-story, &ldquo;The Czar&rsquo;s Daughter in the Underground
Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XX<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">OLA STORBAEKKJEN</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there lived a man in the forest
of Dovre whose name was Ola Storbaekkjen.
He was of giant build, powerful and fearless. During
the winter he did not work, but traveled from
one fair to another, hunting up quarrels and brawls.
From Christiansmarkt he went to Branaes and
Konigsberg, and thence to Grundsaet, and wherever
he came squabbles and brawls broke out, and in
every brawl he was the victor. In the summer he
dealt in cattle at Valders and the fjords, and fought
with the fjord-folk and the hill people of Halling
and Valders, and always had the best of it. But
sometimes they scratched him a bit with the knife,
did those folk.</p>

<p>Now once, at the time of the hay harvest, he was
home at Baekkjen, and had lain down to take a little
after-dinner nap under the penthouse. And he was
taken into the hill, which happened in the following
way: A man with a pair of gilded goat&rsquo;s horns came
along and butted Ola, but Ola fell upon him so that
the man had to duck back, again and again. But
the stranger stood up once more, and began to butt
again, and finally he took Ola under his arm like a
glove, and then both of them flew straight off into
the hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>In the place to which they came all was adorned
with silver plates and dishes, and with ornaments of
silver, and Ola thought that the king himself had
nothing finer. They offered him mead, which he
drank; but eat he would not, for the food did not
seem to him to be appetizing. Suddenly the man
with the gilded goat&rsquo;s horns came in, and gave Ola
a shove before he knew it; but Ola came back at
him as before, and so they beat and pulled each
other through all the rooms, and along all the walls.
Ola was of the opinion that they had been at it all
night long; but by that time the scuffle had lasted
over fourteen days, and they had already tolled the
church bells for him on three successive Thursday
evenings. On the third Thursday evening he was in
ill ease, for the people in the hill had in mind to
thrust him forth. When the bells stopped ringing,
he sat at a crack in the hill, with his head looking
out. Had not a man come by and happened to spy
him, and told the people to keep on ringing the
church-bells, the hill would have closed over him
again, and he would probably still be inside. But
when he came out he had been so badly beaten, and
was so miserable, that it passed all measure. The
lumps on his head were each bigger than the other,
his whole body was black and blue, and he was quite
out of his mind. And from time to time he would
leap up, run off and try to get back into the hill
to take up his quarrel again, and fight for the gilded
goat&rsquo;s horns. For those he wanted to break from
the giant&rsquo;s forehead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE CAT WHO COULD EAT SO MUCH</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a man who had a
cat, and she ate so very much that he did not
want to keep her any longer. So he decided to tie
a stone around her neck, and throw her into the
river; but before he did so she was to have something
to eat just once more. The woman offered her
a dish of mush and a little potful of fat. These she
swallowed, and then jumped out of the window.
There stood the man on the threshing-floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, man in the house,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Have you had
anything to eat yet to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little, but my fast has hardly been
broken,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat, and I am
thinking over whether I ought not to eat you as
well,&rdquo; said she, and she seized the man and ate him
up. Then she went into the stable. There sat the
woman, milking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, woman in the stable,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat, is that you?&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;Have you eaten your food?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little to-day. My fast has hardly been
broken,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in the house, and I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I ought
not to eat you as well,&rdquo; said she, and she seized the
woman and ate her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cow at the manger,&rdquo; said the cat to
the bell-cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat,&rdquo; said the bell-cow. &ldquo;Have you
had anything to eat yet to-day?&rdquo; &ldquo;O, only a little.
My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;I
have had no more than a dish of mush and a little
potful of fat and the man in the house and the
woman in the stable, and I&rsquo;m thinking over whether
I ought not to eat you as well,&rdquo; said the cat, and
seized the bell-cow and ate her up. Then she went
up to the orchard, and there stood a man who was
sweeping up leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, leaf-sweeper in the orchard,&rdquo; said the
cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Have you had
anything to eat yet to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been
broken,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man
in the house and the woman in the stable and the
bell-cow at the manger, and I&rsquo;m thinking over
whether I ought not to eat you up as well,&rdquo; said
she, and seized the leaf-sweeper and ate him up.</p>

<p>Then she came to a stone-pile. There stood the
weasel, looking about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, weasel on the stone-pile,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat,&rdquo; said the weasel. &ldquo;Have you had
anything to eat yet to-day?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man
in the house and the woman in the stable and the
bell-cow at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the
orchard, and I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I ought not
to eat you as well,&rdquo; said the cat, and seized the
weasel and ate him up.</p>

<p>After she had gone a while, she came to a hazel-bush.
There sat the squirrel, gathering nuts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, squirrel in the bush,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you already had anything
to eat yet to-day?&rdquo; said the squirrel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man
in the house and the woman in the stable and the
bell-cow at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the
orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile, and I&rsquo;m
thinking over whether I ought not to eat you up as
well,&rdquo; said she, and seized the squirrel and ate
him up.</p>

<p>After she had gone a little while longer, she met
Reynard the fox, who was peeping out of the edge
of the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, fox, you sly-boots,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the fox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a dish
of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel in
the hazel-bush, and I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I
ought not to eat you as well,&rdquo; said she, and seized
the fox and ate him up too.</p>

<p>When she had gone a little further, she met a
hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, you hopping hare,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the hare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a dish
of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the
house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel in
the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and I&rsquo;m
thinking over whether I ought not to eat you up as
well,&rdquo; said she, and seized the hare and ate him up.</p>

<p>When she had gone a little further, she met a
wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, you wild wolf,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man
in the house and the woman in the stable and the
bell-cow at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the
orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots,
and the hopping hare, and I&rsquo;m thinking over whether
I ought not to eat you up as well,&rdquo; said she, and
seized the wolf and ate him up, too.</p>

<p>Then she went into the wood, and when she had
gone far and farther than far, over hill and dale,
she met a young bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, little bear brown-coat,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little pot of fat and the man in
the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel
in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and
the hopping hare and the wild wolf, and I&rsquo;m thinking
over whether I ought not to eat you up as well,&rdquo; said
she, and seized the little bear and ate him up.</p>

<p>When the cat had gone a bit further, she met the
mother bear, who was clawing at the tree-stems so
that the bark flew, so angry was she to have lost
her little one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, you biting mother bear,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the mother bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a dish
of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in
the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel
in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and
the hopping hare and the wild wolf and the little
bear brown-coat, and I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I
ought not to eat you as well,&rdquo; said she, and seized
the mother bear and ate her, too.</p>

<p>When the cat had gone on a little further, she met
the bear himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Bruin Good-fellow,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; asked the bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a dish
of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the
house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel in the stone-pile and the squirrel in
the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the
hopping hare and the wild wolf and the little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear, and now I&rsquo;m
thinking over whether I ought not to eat you as
well,&rdquo; said she, and she seized the bear and ate him
up, too.</p>

<p>Then the cat went far and farther than far, until
she came into the parish. And there she met a bridal
party on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, bridal party on the road,&rdquo; said the
cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast is hardly broken,&rdquo; said
the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a dish of mush
and a little potful of fat and the man in the house
and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow at the
manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard and
the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel in the
hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the hopping
hare and the wild wolf and the little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear and bruin
good-fellow and now I&rsquo;m thinking whether I ought
not to eat you up as well,&rdquo; said she, and she
pounced on the whole bridal party, and ate it up,
with the cook, the musicians, the horses and all.</p>

<p>When she had gone a bit farther, she came to the
church. And there she met a funeral procession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, funeral procession at the church,&rdquo;
said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the funeral procession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a
dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man
in the house and the woman in the stable and the
bell-cow at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in
the orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile and the
squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots,
and the hopping hare and the wild wolf and little
bear brown-coat and the biting mother bear and
bruin good-fellow and the bridal party on the road,
and now I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I ought not to
eat you up as well,&rdquo; said she, and pounced on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
funeral procession, and ate up corpse and procession.</p>

<p>When the cat had swallowed it all, she went
straight on up to the sky, and when she had gone
far and farther than far, she met the moon in a
cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, moon in a cloud,&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, cat! Have you had anything to eat
yet to-day?&rdquo; said the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no more than a dish
of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the
house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel in
the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the
wild wolf and little bear brown-coat and the biting
mother bear and bruin good-fellow and the bridal
party on the road and the funeral procession at the
church, and now I&rsquo;m thinking over whether I ought
not to eat you up as well,&rdquo; said she, and pounced
on the moon and ate him up, half and full.</p>

<p>Then the cat went far and farther than far, and
met the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, cat! Have you had anything to
eat yet to-day?&rdquo; said the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little,&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;I have had no
more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat
and the man in the house and the woman in the
stable and the bell-cow at the manger and the leaf-sweeper
in the orchard and the weasel on the stone-pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and the squirrel in the hazel-bush and the fox,
the sly-boots, and the hopping hare and the wild
wolf and little bear brown-coat and the biting mother
bear and bruin good-fellow and the bridal party on
the road and the funeral procession at the church
and the moon in a cloud, and now I&rsquo;m thinking over
whether I ought not to eat you up as well,&rdquo; said she,
and pounced on the sun in the sky and ate him up.</p>

<p>Then the cat went far and farther than far, until
she came to a bridge, and there she met a large billy-goat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, billy-goat on the broad bridge,&rdquo;
said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, cat! Have you had anything to
eat yet to-day?&rdquo; said the goat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, only a little. My fast has hardly been broken,&rdquo;
said the cat. &ldquo;I had no more than a dish of
mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the
house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel in
the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and the
hopping hare and the wild wolf and little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear and bruin
good-fellow and the bridal party on the road and
the funeral procession at the church and the moon
in a cloud and the sun in the sky, and now I&rsquo;m thinking
over whether I ought not to eat you up as well,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight about that first of all,&rdquo; said the goat,
and butted the cat with his horns so that she rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
off the bridge, and fell into the water, and there
she burst.</p>

<p>Then they all crawled out, and each went to his
own place, all whom the cat had eaten up, and were
every one of them as lively as before, the man in
the house and the woman in the stable and the bell-cow
at the manger and the leaf-sweeper in the orchard
and the weasel on the stone-pile and the squirrel
in the hazel-bush and the fox, the sly-boots, and
the hopping hare and the wild wolf and little bear
brown-coat and the biting mother bear and bruin
good-fellow and the bridal party on the road and
the funeral procession at the church and the moon in
a cloud and the sun in the sky.</p>

<h2>XXII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a poor tenant
farmer who had a number of children whom
he could feed but poorly, and had to clothe in the
scantiest way. They were all handsome; but the
most beautiful, after all, was the youngest daughter,
for she was beautiful beyond all telling.</p>

<p>Now it happened that one Thursday evening late
in the fall there was a terrible storm raging outside.
It was pitch dark, and it rained and stormed so that
the house shook in every joint. The whole family
sat around the hearth, and each was busy with some
work or other. Suddenly there were three loud
knocks on the window-pane. The man went out to
see who was there, and when he stepped outside,
there stood a great white bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said the white bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; returned the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll give me your youngest daughter, I will
make you just as rich as now you are poor,&rdquo; said
the bear.</p>

<p>The man was not ill-pleased that he was to become
so rich; yet he did think that first he ought to speak
to his daughter about it. So he went in again, and
said that there was a white bear outside, who had
promised to make him just as rich as he was poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
now, if he could only have the youngest daughter for
his bride. But the girl said no, and would not hear
of it. Then the man went back to the bear again,
and they both agreed that the white bear should
return again the following Thursday and get his answer.
In the meantime, however, the parents worked
upon their daughter, and talked at length about all
the riches they would gain, and how well she herself
would fare. So at last she agreed, washed and
mended the few poor clothes she had, adorned herself
as well as she could, and made ready to travel.
And what she was given to take along with her is
not worth mentioning, either.</p>

<p>The following Thursday the white bear came to
fetch his bride. The girl seated herself on his back
with her bundle, and then he trotted off. After they
had gone a good way, the white bear asked: &ldquo;Are
you afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just keep a tight hold on my fur, and then you
will be in no danger,&rdquo; said the bear. So she rode
on the bear&rsquo;s back, far, far away, until at last they
came to a great rock. There the bear knocked, and
at once a door opened through which they entered a
great castle, with many brilliantly lighted rooms,
where everything gleamed with gold and silver.
Then they came into a great hall, and there stood a
table completely covered with the most splendid
dishes. Here the white bear gave the maiden a
silver bell, and said that if there were anything she
wanted, she need only ring the bell, and she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
have it at once. And after the maiden had eaten,
and evening came on, she felt like lying down and
going to sleep. So she rang her bell; and at its very
first peal she found herself transported to a room in
which stood the most beautiful bed one might wish
to have, with silken cushions and curtains with
golden tassels; and all that was in the room was
of gold and silver. Yet when she had lain down and
put out the light, she saw a man come in and cast
himself down in a corner. It was the white bear,
who was allowed to throw off his fur at night; yet
the maiden never actually saw him, for he never came
until she had put out the light, and before dawn
brightened he had disappeared again.</p>

<p>For a time all went well; but gradually the maiden
grew sad and silent; for she had not a soul to keep
her company the live-long day, and she felt very
homesick for her parents and sisters. When the
white bear asked her what troubled her, she told him
she was always alone, and that she wanted so very
much to see her parents and sisters again, and felt
very sad because she could not do so. &ldquo;O that can
be managed,&rdquo; said the white bear. &ldquo;But first you
must promise me that you will never speak to your
mother alone; but only when others are present.
Very likely she will take you by the hand, and want
to lead you into her room, so that she can speak to
you alone. But this you must not allow, otherwise
you will make us both unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, one Sunday, the white bear actually
came and told her that now she might make the trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to her parents. So she seated herself on the bear&rsquo;s
back, and the bear set out. After they had gone a
very long distance, they at length came to a fine,
large, white house, before which her brothers and
sisters were running about and playing, and all was
so rich and splendid that it was a real pleasure
merely to look at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is where your parents live,&rdquo; said the white
bear. &ldquo;Only do not forget what I told you, or you
will make us both unhappy.&rdquo; Heaven forbid that
she should forget it, said the maiden; and when she
had come to the house, she got down, and the bear
turned back.</p>

<p>When the daughter entered her parents&rsquo; home,
they were more than happy; they told her that they
could not thank her enough for what she had done,
and that now all of them were doing splendidly.
Then they asked her how she herself fared. The
maiden answered that all was well with her, also,
and that she had all that heart could desire. I do
not know exactly all the other things she told them;
but I do not believe she told them every last thing
there was to tell. So in the afternoon, when the
family had eaten dinner, it happened as the white
bear had foretold; the mother wanted to talk to her
daughter alone, in her room; but she thought of
what the white bear had told her, and did not want
to go with her mother, but said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All we have to say to each other can just as well
be said here.&rdquo; Yet&mdash;she herself did not know
exactly how it happened&mdash;her mother finally did persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
her, and then she had to tell just how things
were. So she informed her that as soon as she put
out the light at night, a man came and cast himself
down in the corner of the room. She had never
yet seen him, for he always went away before the
dawn brightened. And this grieved her, for she did
want to see him so very much, and she was alone
through the day, and it was very dreary and lonely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, perhaps he is a troll, after all,&rdquo; said the
mother. &ldquo;But I can give you some good advice as to
how you can see him. Here is a candle-end, which
you must hide under your wimple. When the troll
is sleeping, light the light and look at him. But be
careful not to let a drop of tallow fall on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The daughter took the candle-end and hid it in her
wimple, and in the evening the white bear came to
fetch her.</p>

<p>After they had gone a way the white bear asked
whether everything had not happened just as he had
said. Yes, such had been the case, and the maiden
could not deny it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have listened to your mother&rsquo;s advice,
then you will make us both unhappy, and all will be
over between us,&rdquo; said the bear. &ldquo;O, no, she had
not done so,&rdquo; replied the maiden, indeed she had not.</p>

<p>When they reached home, and the maiden had
gone to bed, all went as usual: a man came in and
cast himself down in a corner of the room. But in
the night, when she heard him sleeping soundly, she
stood up and lighted the candle. She threw the light
on him, and saw the handsomest prince one might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wish to see. And she liked him so exceedingly well
that she thought she would be unable to keep on living
if she could not kiss him that very minute. She
did so, but by mistake she let three hot drops of
tallow fall on him, and he awoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, what have you done!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Now
you have made both of us unhappy. If you had only
held out until the end of the year, I would have been
delivered. I have a step-mother who has cast a spell
on me, so that by day I am a bear, and at night a
human being. But now all is over between us,
and I must return to my step-mother. She lives in
a castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon,
where there is a princess with a nose three yards
long, whom I must now marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden wept and wailed; but to no avail, for
the prince said he must journey away. Then she
asked him whether she might not go with him. No,
said he, that could not be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can you not at least tell me the road, so that
I can search for you. For surely that will be permitted
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that you may do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But there is no
road that leads there. The castle lies east of the
sun and west of the moon, and neither now nor at any
other time will you find the road to it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the maiden awoke the next morning, the
prince as well as the castle had disappeared. She
lay in a green opening in the midst of a thick, dark
wood, and beside her lay the bundle of poor belongings
she had brought from home. And when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and had cried
her fill, she set out and wandered many, many days,
until at last she came to a great hill. And before
the hill sat an old woman who was playing with a
golden apple. The maiden asked the woman whether
she did not know which road led to the prince who
lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west
of the moon, and who was to marry a princess with a
nose three yards long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you come to know him?&rdquo; asked the
woman. &ldquo;Are you, perhaps, the maiden he wanted
to marry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am that maiden,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are that girl,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Well,
my child, I am sorry to say that all I know of him
is that he lives in the castle that is east of the sun
and west of the moon, and that you will probably
never get there. But I will loan you my horse, on
which you may ride to my neighbor, and perhaps she
can tell you. And when you get there just give the
horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to
go home. And here, take this golden apple along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden mounted the horse, and rode a long,
long time. At length she again came to a hill, before
which sat an old woman with a golden reel.
The maiden asked whether she could not tell her the
road which led to the castle that lay east of the
sun and west of the moon. This woman said just
what the other had, no, she knew no more of the
castle than that it lay east of the sun and west of
the moon. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you will probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
never get there. But I will loan you my horse to
ride to the nearest neighbor; perhaps she can tell
you. And when you have reached her just give the
horse a blow back of his left ear, and order him to
go home again.&rdquo; And finally she gave the maiden
the golden reel, for, said the old woman, it might
be useful to her.</p>

<p>The maiden then mounted the horse, and again
rode a long, long time. At length she once more
came to a great hill, before which sat an old woman
spinning at a golden spindle. Then the maiden once
more asked after the prince, and the castle that lay
east of the sun and west of the moon. And everything
happened exactly as on the two previous occasions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to be the maiden the prince
wanted to marry?&rdquo; asked the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am that maiden,&rdquo; answered the maiden.</p>

<p>But this old woman knew no more about the road
than the two others. &ldquo;Yes, the castle lies east of
the sun and west of the moon, that I know,&rdquo; said
she. &ldquo;And you will probably never get there. But
I will loan you my horse, and you may ride on it to
the East Wind and ask him. Perhaps he is acquainted
there, and can blow you thither. And when
you reach him, just give my horse a blow back of
the left ear, and then he will return here of his
own accord.&rdquo; Finally the old woman gave her her
golden spindle. &ldquo;Perhaps it may be useful to you,&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>The maiden now rode for many days and weeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and it took a long, long time before she came to the
East Wind. But at last she did find him, and then
she asked the East Wind whether he could show her
the road that led to the prince who lived in the castle
that was east of the sun and west of the moon.</p>

<p>O, yes, he had heard tell of the prince, and of the
castle as well, said the East Wind, but he did not
know the road that led to it, for he had never blown
so far. &ldquo;But if you wish, I will take you to my
brother, the West Wind, and perhaps he can tell
you, for he is much stronger than I am. Just sit
down on my back, and I will carry you to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden did as he told her, and then they
moved swiftly away. When they came to the West
Wind, the East Wind said that here he was bringing
the maiden whom the prince who lived in the
castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon
had wanted to marry, that she was journeying on her
way to him, and looking for him everywhere, and
that he had accompanied her in order to find out
whether the West Wind knew where this castle
might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the West Wind to the maiden, &ldquo;I
have never blown so far, but if you wish I will take
you to the South Wind, who is much stronger than
both of us, and has traveled far and wide, and perhaps
he can tell you. Seat yourself on my back, and
I will carry you to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden did so, and then they flew quickly off
to the South Wind. When they found him, the West
Wind asked whether the South Wind could show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
them the road that led to the castle that lay east of
the sun and west of the moon; and that this was the
maiden who was to have the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, so this is the girl?&rdquo; cried the South
Wind. &ldquo;Yes, it is true that I have gone about a
good deal during my life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;yet I have never
blown so far. But if you wish, I will take you to
my brother, the North Wind. He is the oldest and
strongest of us all. If he does not know where the
castle lies, then no one in the whole world can tell
you. Seat yourself on my back, and I will carry you
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden seated herself on the back of the South
Wind, and he flew away with a roar and a rush. The
journey did not take long.</p>

<p>When they had reached the dwelling of the North
Wind, the latter was so wild and unmannerly that
he blew a cold blast at them while they were still a
good way off. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; cried he, as
soon as he caught sight of them, so that a cold shiver
ran down their backs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not greet us so rudely,&rdquo; said the
South Wind. &ldquo;It is I, the South Wind. And this is
the maiden who wanted to marry the prince who lives
in the castle that lies east of the sun and west of the
moon. She wishes to ask you whether you have ever
been there, and if you can show her the road that
leads to it; for she would like to find the prince
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes, I know very well where the castle lies,&rdquo;
said the North Wind. &ldquo;I blew an aspen leaf there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
just once, and then I was so weary that I could not
blow at all for many a long day. But if you want to
get there above all things, and are not afraid of me,
I will take you on my back, and see whether I can
blow you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden said that she must and would get to
the castle, if it were by any means possible, and that
she was not afraid, no matter how hard the journey
might be. &ldquo;Very well, then you must stay here over
night,&rdquo; said the North Wind. &ldquo;For if we are to
get there to-morrow, we must have the whole day
before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early the next morning the North Wind awakened
the maiden. Then he blew himself up, and
made himself so large and thick that he was quite
horrible to look at, and thereupon they rushed along
through the air as though they meant to reach the
end of the world at once. And everywhere beneath
them raged such a storm that forests were pulled out
by the roots, and houses torn down, and as they
rushed across the sea, ships foundered by the hundreds.
Further and further they went, so far that no
one could even imagine it, and still they were flying
across the sea; but gradually the North Wind grew
weary, and became weaker and weaker. Finally he
could hardly keep going, and sank lower and lower,
and at last he flew so low that the waves washed his
ankles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; asked the North Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; answered the maiden. By now
they were not far distant from the land, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
North Wind had just enough strength left to be able
to set down the maiden on the strand, beneath the
windows of the castle that lay east of the sun and
west of the moon. And then he was so wearied and
wretched that he had to rest many a long day before
he could set out for home again.</p>

<p>The next morning the maiden seated herself beneath
the windows of the castle and played with the
golden apple, and the first person who showed herself
was the monster with the nose, whom the prince
was to marry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want for your golden apple?&rdquo; asked
the princess with the nose, as she opened the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not sell it at all, either for gold or for
money,&rdquo; answered the maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want for it, if you will not sell
it either for gold or for money?&rdquo; asked the princess.
&ldquo;Ask what you will!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only want to speak to-night to the prince who
lives here, then I will give you the apple,&rdquo; said the
maiden who had come with the North Wind.</p>

<p>The princess replied that this could be arranged,
and then she received the golden apple. But when
the maiden came into the prince&rsquo;s room in the evening,
he was sleeping soundly. She called and shook
him, wept and wailed; but she could not wake him,
and in the morning, as soon as it dawned, the princess
with the long nose came and drove her out.</p>

<p>That day the maiden again sat beneath the windows
of the castle, and wound her golden reel. And
all went as on the preceding day. The princess asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
what she wanted for the reel, and the maiden answered
that she would sell it neither for gold nor
for money; but if she might speak that night to the
prince, then she would give the reel to the princess.
Yet when the maiden came to the prince, he was
again fast asleep, and no matter how much she wept
and wailed, and cried and shook, she could not wake
him. But as soon as day dawned, and it grew bright,
the princess with the long nose came and drove her
out. And that day the maiden again seated herself
beneath the windows of the castle, and spun with her
golden spindle; and, of course, the princess with the
long nose wanted to have that, too. She opened the
window, and asked what she wanted for the golden
spindle. The maiden replied, as she had twice before,
that she would sell the spindle neither for gold
nor money; but that the princess could have it if she
might speak to the prince again that night. Yes,
that she was welcome to do, said the princess, and
took the golden spindle. Now it happened that some
Christians, who were captives in the castle, and
quartered in a room beside that of the prince, had
heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the
prince&rsquo;s room for the past two nights. So they told
the prince. And that evening when the princess
came to him with his night-cap, the prince pretended
to drink it; but instead poured it out behind his back,
for he could well imagine that she had put a sleeping-powder
into the cup. Then, when the maiden
came in, the prince was awake, and she had to tell
him just how she had found the castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come just in the nick of time,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;for to-morrow I am to marry the princess; but
I do not want the monster with the nose at all, and
you are the only person who can save me. I will
say that first I wish to see whether my bride is a
capable housewife, and demand that she wash the
three drops of tallow from my shirt. She will naturally
agree to this, for she does not know that you
made the spots, for only Christian hands can wash
them out again, but not the hands of this pack of
trolls. Then I will say I will marry none other than
the maiden who can wash out the spots, and ask
you to do so,&rdquo; said the prince. And then both rejoiced
and were happy beyond measure.</p>

<p>But on the following day, when the wedding was
to take place, the prince said: &ldquo;First I would like to
see what my bride can do!&rdquo; Yes, that was no more
than right, said his mother-in-law. &ldquo;I have a very
handsome shirt,&rdquo; continued the prince, &ldquo;which I
would like to wear at the wedding. But there are
three tallow-spots on it, and they must first be
washed out. And I have made a vow to marry
none other than the woman who can do this. So
if my bride cannot manage to do it, then she is
worthless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, that would not be much of a task, said the
women, and agreed to the proposal. And the princess
with the long nose at once began to wash. She
washed with all her might and main, and took the
greatest pains, but the longer she washed and
rubbed, the larger grew the spots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you don&rsquo;t know how to wash!&rdquo; said her
mother, the old troll-wife. &ldquo;Just give it to me!&rdquo;
But no sooner had she taken the shirt in her hand,
than it began to look worse, and the more she washed
and rubbed, the larger and blacker grew the spots.
Then the other troll-women had to come and wash;
but the longer they washed the shirt the uglier it
grew, and finally it looked as though it had been
hanging in the smokestack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, all of you are worthless!&rdquo; said the prince.
&ldquo;Outside the window sits a beggar-girl. I&rsquo;m sure
she is a better washer-woman than all of you put together.
You, girl, come in here!&rdquo; he cried out of
the window; and when the maiden came in he said:
&ldquo;Do you think you can wash this shirt clean for
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; answered the maiden, &ldquo;but I
will try.&rdquo; And no more had she dipped the shirt
in the water than it turned as white as newly fallen
snow, yes, even whiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and you are the one I want!&rdquo; said the
prince.</p>

<p>Then the old troll-woman grew so angry that she
burst in two, and the princess with the long nose
and the rest of the troll-pack probably burst in two
as well, for I never heard anything more of them.
The prince and his bride then freed all the Christians
who had been kept captive in the castle, and packed
up as much gold and silver as they could possibly
take with them, and went far away from the castle
that lies East of the sun and West of the moon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXIII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">MURMUR GOOSE-EGG</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there were five women who
were standing in a field, mowing. Heaven had
not given a single one of them a child, and each of
them wanted to have one. And suddenly they saw a
goose-egg of quite unheard-of size, well-nigh as
large as a man&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I saw it first,&rdquo; said the
one. &ldquo;I saw it at the same time that you did,&rdquo; insisted
another. &ldquo;But I want it, for I saw it first of
all,&rdquo; maintained a third. And thus they went on,
and fought so about the egg that they nearly came
to blows. Finally they agreed that it should belong
to all five of them, and that all of them should sit
on it, as a goose would do, and hatch out the little
gosling. The first remained sitting on the egg for
eight days, and hatched, and did not move or do a
thing; and during this time the rest had to feed her
and themselves as well. One of them grew angry
because of this and scolded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not crawl out of the egg either before
you could cry peep!&rdquo; said the one who was sitting
on the egg and hatching. &ldquo;Yet I almost believe that
a human child is going to slip out of the egg, for
something is murmuring inside it without ever stopping:
&lsquo;Herring and mush, porridge and milk,&rsquo;&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
she. &ldquo;And now you can sit on it for eight days,
while we bring you food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the fifth day of the eight had passed, it was
plain to her that there was a child in the egg, which
kept on calling: &ldquo;Herring and mush, porridge
and milk,&rdquo; and so she punched a hole in the egg, and
instead of a gosling out came a child, and it was
quite disgustingly homely, with a big head and a
small body, and no sooner had it crawled out than
it began to cry: &ldquo;Herring and mush, porridge and
milk!&rdquo; So they named the child Murmur Goose-Egg.</p>

<p>In spite of the child&rsquo;s homeliness, the women at
first took a great deal of pleasure in him; but before
long he grew so greedy that he devoured everything
they had. When they cooked a dish of mush or a
potful of porridge that was to do for all six of them,
the child swallowed it all by himself. So they did not
want to keep him any longer. &ldquo;I have not had a
single full meal since the changling crawled out,&rdquo;
said one of them; and when Murmur Goose-Egg
heard that, and the rest agreed, he said that he
would gladly go his own gait, for &ldquo;if they had no
need of him, then he had no need of them,&rdquo; and with
that he went off. Finally he came to a farmstead
that lay in a rocky section, and asked for work.
Yes, they needed a workman, and the master told
him to gather up the stones in the field. Then Murmur
Goose-Egg gathered up the stones in the field;
he picked up some that were so large that a number
of horses could not have dragged them, and large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and small, one and all, he put them in his pocket.
Before long he had finished his work, and wanted
to know what he was to do next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have picked up the stones in the field?&rdquo; said
his master. &ldquo;You cannot possibly have finished before
you have really begun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Murmur Goose-Egg emptied his pockets, and
threw the stones on a pile. Then his master saw
that he had finished his work, and that one would
have to handle such a strong fellow with kid gloves.
So he told him to come in and eat. That suited
Murmur Goose-Egg, and he ate up everything that
was to have supplied the master and his family, and
the help, and then he was only half satisfied.</p>

<p>He was really a splendid worker; but a dangerous
eater, like a bottomless cask, said the peasant.
&ldquo;Such a serving-man could eat up a poor peasant,
house and ground, before he noticed it,&rdquo; said he.
He had no more work for him, and the best thing to
do would be to go to the king&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p>So Murmur Goose-Egg went to the king, and was
at once given a place, and there was enough to eat
and drink in the castle. He was to be the errand-boy,
and help the maids fetch wood and water, and do
other odd jobs. So he asked what he was to do
first.</p>

<p>For the time being he could chop fire-wood, said
they. So Murmur Goose-Egg began to chop fire-wood,
and hewed to the line in such fashion that the
chips fairly flew. Before long he had chopped up
all that there was, kindling wood and building wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
beams and boards, and when he was through with
it, he came and asked what he was to do now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can finish chopping the fire-wood,&rdquo; said
they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is none left,&rdquo; said Murmur Goose-Egg.</p>

<p>That could not be possible, said the superintendent,
and looked into the wood-bin. Yes, indeed,
Murmur Goose-Egg had chopped up everything,
large and small, beams and boards. That was very
bad, and therefore the superintendent said that Murmur
Goose-Egg should have nothing to eat until he
had chopped down just as much wood in the forest
as he had just chopped up for fire-wood.</p>

<p>Then Murmur Goose-Egg went into the smithy,
and had the smith make an iron ax of five hundred-weights.
With that he went into the forest and
began to chop. He chopped down big pine and fir
trees, as thick as masts, and all that he found on the
king&rsquo;s ground, as well as what he found on that of
his neighbors. But he cut off neither the branches
nor the tree-tops, so that all lay there as though
felled by the storm. Then he loaded a sizable stack
on the sled, and put to the horses. But they could
not move the load from the spot, and when he took
them by the heads, in order to pull them forward,
he tore off their heads. So he unharnessed them,
and left them lying in the field, and put himself to
the sled, and went off alone with the load. When
he came to the king&rsquo;s castle, there stood the king
with the master carpenter in the entrance, and they
were ready to give him a warm reception, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of the destruction he had wrought in the forest. For
the master carpenter had been there and seen the
havoc he had made. But when Murmur Goose-Egg
came along with half the forest, the king grew frightened
as well as angry, and he thought that if Murmur
was so strong, it would be best to handle him
with care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you are a splendid workman,&rdquo; said the
king, &ldquo;but tell me, how much do you really eat at
once,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for I am sure you are
hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he were to have enough porridge, they would
have to take twelve tons of meal to make it; but
after he had eaten that, then he could wait a while,
said Murmur Goose-Egg.</p>

<p>It took some time before so much porridge could
be prepared, and in the meantime Murmur was to
carry wood into the kitchen. So he piled the whole
load of wood on a sled, but when he drove it through
the door, he did not go to work about it very gently.
The house nearly broke from its joints, and he well-nigh
tore down the entire castle. When at last dinner
was ready, they sent him out into the field, to
call the help. He called so loudly that hill and vale
reëchoed the sound. But still the people did not
come quick enough to suit him. So he picked a quarrel
with them, and killed twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You kill twelve of my people, and you eat for
twelve times twelve of them, but how many men&rsquo;s
work can you do?&rdquo; asked the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do the work of twelve times twelve, too,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Murmur. When he had eaten, he was to go to the
barn and thresh. So he pulled the beam out of the
roof-tree, and made a flail out of it, and when the
roof threatened to fall in, he took a pine-tree with
all its boughs and branches, and set it up in place
of the roof-beam. Then he threshed corn and hay
and straw, all together, and it seemed as though a
cloud hung over the royal castle.</p>

<p>When Murmur Goose-Egg had nearly finished
threshing, the enemy broke into the land, and war
began. Then the king told him to gather people
about him, and go to meet the foe, and do battle
with him, for he thought the enemy would probably
kill him.</p>

<p>No, said Murmur Goose-Egg, he did not want to
have the king&rsquo;s people killed, he would see that he
dealt with the enemy himself.</p>

<p>All the better, thought the king, then I am sure
to get rid of him. But he would need a proper club,
said Murmur.</p>

<p>So they sent to the smith, and he forged a club of
two hundred-weights. That would only do for a
nut-cracker, said Murmur Goose-Egg. So he forged
another that weighed six hundred-weights, and that
would do to hammer shoes with, said Murmur Goose-Egg.
But the smith told him that he and all his
workmen together could not forge a larger one.</p>

<p>Then Murmur Goose-Egg went into the smithy
himself, and forged himself a club of thirty hundred-weights,
and it would have taken a hundred men
just to turn it around on the anvil. This might do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
at a pinch, said Murmur. Then he wanted a knapsack
with provisions. It was sewn together out of
fifteen ox-skins, and stuffed full of provisions, and
then Murmur wandered down the hill with the knapsack
on his back, and the club over his shoulder.</p>

<p>When he came near enough for the soldiers to
see him, they sent to ask whether he had a mind to
attack them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait until I have eaten,&rdquo; said Murmur, and
sat him down behind his knapsack to eat. But the
enemy would not wait, and began to fire at him.
And it fairly rained and hailed musket-balls all
around Murmur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a fig for these blueberries,&rdquo; said
Murmur Goose-Egg, and feasted on quite at ease.
Neither lead nor iron could wound him, and his knapsack
stood before him, and caught the bullets like
a wall.</p>

<p>Then the enemy began to throw bombs at him, and
shoot at him with cannon. He hardly moved when
he was struck. &ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s of no account!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>But then a bomb flew into his wind-pipe.
&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; said he, and spat it out again, and then
came a chain-bullet and fell into his butter-plate,
and another tore away the bit of bread from between
his fingers.</p>

<p>Then he grew angry, stood up, took his club,
pounded the ground with it, and asked whether they
wanted to take the food from his mouth with the
blueberries they were blowing out at him from their
clumsy blow-pipes. Then he struck a few more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
blows, so that the hills and valleys round about trembled,
and all the enemy flew up into the air like
chaff, and that was the end of the war.</p>

<p>When Murmur came back and asked for more
work, the king was at a loss, for he had felt sure
that now he was rid of him. So he knew of nothing
better to do than to send him to the devil&rsquo;s place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you can go to the devil, and fetch the tribute
from him,&rdquo; said the king. Murmur Goose-Egg went
off with his knapsack on his back, and his club over
his shoulder. He had soon reached the right spot;
but when he got there the devil was away at a trial.
There was no one home but his grandmother, and
she said she had never yet heard anything about a
tribute, and that he was to come back some other
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, come again to-morrow,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I know that old excuse!&rdquo; But since he was there,
he would stay there, for he had to take home the
tribute, and he had plenty of time to wait. But when
he had eaten all his provisions, he grew weary, and
again demanded the tribute from the grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will get nothing from me, and that&rsquo;s as flat
as the old fir-tree outside is fast,&rdquo; said the devil&rsquo;s
grandmother. The fir-tree stood in front of the gate
to the devil&rsquo;s place, and was so large that fifteen
men could hardly girdle it with their arms. But
Murmur climbed up into its top and bent and shook
it to and fro as though it were a willow wand, and
then asked the devil&rsquo;s grandmother once more
whether she would now pay him the tribute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>So she did not dare to refuse any longer, and
brought out as much money as he could possibly
carry in his knapsack. Then he set out for home
with the tribute, and now no sooner had he gone
than the devil came home, and when he learned that
Murmur had taken along a big bag of money, he
first beat his grandmother, and then hurried after
Murmur. And he soon caught up to him, for he ran
over sticks and stones, and sometimes flew in between;
while Murmur had to stick to the highway
with his heavy knapsack. But with the devil at his
heels, he began to run as fast as he could, and
stretched out the club behind him, to keep the devil
from coming to close quarters. And thus they ran
along, one behind the other; while Murmur held
the shaft and the devil the end of the club, until they
reached a deep valley. There Murmur jumped from
one mountain-top to another, and the devil followed
him so hotly that he ran into the club, fell down
into the valley and broke his foot&mdash;and there he
lay.</p>

<span class="flr">&mdash;Page 189</span></span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your tribute!&rdquo; said Murmur Goose-Egg,
when he had reached the royal castle, and he flung
down the knapsack full of money before the king,
so that the whole castle tottered. The king thanked
him kindly, and promised him a good reward, and a
good character, if he wanted it; but Murmur only
wanted more work to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do now?&rdquo; he asked. The king reflected
for a while, and then he said Murmur should
travel to the hill-troll, who had robbed him of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sword of his ancestors. He lived in a castle by the
sea, where no one ventured to go.</p>

<p>Murmur was given a few cart-loads of provisions
in his big knapsack, and once more set out. Long
he wandered, though, over field and wood, over hills
and deep valleys, till he came to a great mountain
where the troll lived who had robbed the king of
the sword.</p>

<p>But the troll was not out in the open, and the
mountain was closed, so Murmur could not get it.
So he joined a party of stone-breakers, who were
working at a mountainside, and worked along with
them. They had never had such a helper, for Murmur
hewed away at the rocks till they burst, and
stone bowlders as large as houses came rolling down.
But when he was about to rest and eat up the first
cart-load of his provisions, it had already been eaten
up. &ldquo;I have a good appetite myself,&rdquo; said Murmur,
&ldquo;but whoever got hold of it has an even better one,
for he has eaten up the bones as well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it went the first day, and the second was no
better. On the third day he went to work again, and
took along the third cart-load, lay down behind it,
and pretended to be sleeping.</p>

<p>Then a troll with seven heads came out of the hill,
began to smack his lips, and eat of his provisions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the table is set, so now I am going to eat,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First we&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said Murmur, and
hewed away at the troll so that the heads flew from
his body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he went into the hill out of which the troll
had come, and inside stood a horse eating out of a
barrel of glowing ashes, while behind him stood a
barrel filled with oats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat out of the barrel of oats?&rdquo;
asked Murmur Goose-Egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot turn around,&rdquo; said the horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will turn you around,&rdquo; said Murmur Goose-Egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tear my head off instead,&rdquo; pleaded the horse.</p>

<p>Murmur did so, and then the horse turned into
a fine-looking man. He said that he had been enchanted,
and turned into a horse by the troll. Then
he helped Murmur look for the sword, which the
troll had hidden under the bed. But in the bed lay
the troll&rsquo;s grandmother, and she was snoring.</p>

<p>They went home by water, and just as they sailed
off the old troll grandmother came after them; but
she could not get at them, hence she commenced to
drink, so that the water went down and grew lower.
But at last she could not drink up the whole sea,
and so she burst.</p>

<p>When they came ashore, Murmur sent to the king,
and had him told to have the sword fetched; but
though the king sent four horses, they could not
move it from the spot. He sent eight, he sent twelve,
but the sword remained where it was, and could not
be moved from the spot by any means. Then Murmur
Goose-Egg took it up, and carried it alone.</p>

<p>The king could not believe his eyes when he saw
Murmur once more; but he was very friendly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
promised him gold and green forests. But when
Murmur asked for more work, he told him to travel
to his troll&rsquo;s castle, where no one dared go, and to
remain there until he had built a bridge across the
sound, so that people could cross. If he could do
that, he would reward him well, yes, he would even
give him his daughter, said the king. He would
attend to it, said Murmur.</p>

<p>Yet no human being had ever returned thence
alive; all who had gotten so far, lay on the ground
dead, and crushed to a jelly, and the king thought,
when sending him there, that he would never see
him again.</p>

<p>But Murmur set out. He took with him his knapsack
full of provisions, and a properly turned and
twisted block of pine-wood, as well as an ax, a wedge
and some wooden chips.</p>

<p>When he reached the sound, the river was full
of drifting ice, and it roared like a waterfall. But
he planted his legs firmly on the ground, and waded
along until he got across. When he had warmed
himself and satisfied his hunger, he wanted to sleep;
but a tumult and rumbling started, as though the
whole castle were to be turned upside down. The
gate flew wide open, and Murmur saw nothing but
a pair of yawning jaws that reached from the
threshold to the top of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who you may be? Perhaps you are
an old friend of mine,&rdquo; said Murmur. And sure
enough, it was Master Devil. Then they played
cards together. The devil would gladly have won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
back some of the tribute Murmur had forced from
his grandmother for the king. Yet, no matter how
he played, Murmur always won; for he made a cross
on the cards. And after he had won all the devil
had with him, the latter had to give him some of
the gold and silver that was in the castle.</p>

<p>In the midst of their game the fire went out, so
that they could no longer tell the cards apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we must split wood,&rdquo; said Murmur. He
hewed into the block of pine-wood with his ax, and
drove in the wedge, but the tree-stump was tough,
and would not split at once, though Murmur gave
himself all manner of pains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are supposed to be strong,&rdquo; he said to the
devil. &ldquo;Spit on your hands, slap in your claws here,
and pull the block apart, so that I can see what you
can do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The devil obediently thrust both hands into the
split, and tore and clawed with all his might; but
suddenly Murmur Goose-Egg knocked out the wedge,
and there the devil was caught in a vice, while Murmur
belabored his back with the ax. The devil
wailed, and begged Murmur to let him go; but Murmur
would hear nothing of it until he had promised
never to come back and make a nuisance of himself
again. Besides that, he had to promise to build a
bridge over the sound, on which one could go back
and forth at all seasons of the year. And the bridge
was to be completed immediately after the breaking
up of the ice-drift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the devil, but there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for it but to promise if he wished to go free. Yet
he made one condition, that he was to have the first
soul that crossed the bridge as sound-toll.</p>

<p>He could have it, said Murmur. Then he let the
devil out, and he ran straight home. But Murmur
lay down and slept until far into the following day.</p>

<p>Then the king came to see whether Murmur Goose-Egg
were lying crushed on the ground, or had merely
been badly beaten. He had to wade through piles
of money before he could reach the bed. The money
was stacked up high along the walls in heaps and in
bags, and Murmur lay in the bed and snored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May heaven help me and my daughter!&rdquo; cried
the king, when he saw that Murmur Goose-Egg was
in the best of health. Yes, and no one could deny
that everything had been well and thoroughly done,
said the king; but there could be no talk of marriage
as long as the bridge had not been built.</p>

<p>Then one day the bridge was finished; and on it
stood the devil, ready to collect the toll promised
him.</p>

<p>Murmur Goose-Egg wanted the king to be the first
to try the bridge with him; but the king had no
mind to do so, therefore Murmur himself mounted
a horse, and swung up the fat dairy-maid from the
castle before him on the saddle-bow&mdash;she looked
almost like a gigantic block of wood&mdash;and dashed
across the bridge with her so that the planks fairly
thundered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is my sound-toll? Where is the soul?&rdquo;
cried the devil. &ldquo;Sitting in this block of wood! If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
you want her, you must spit on your hands and catch
hold of her,&rdquo; said Murmur Goose-Egg. &ldquo;No, thank
you! If she does not catch hold of me, then I&rsquo;ll
certainly not catch hold of her,&rdquo; said the devil.
&ldquo;You caught me in a vice once, but you can&rsquo;t fool
me a second time,&rdquo; said he, and flew straight home
to his grandmother, and since then nothing more
has been heard or seen of him.</p>

<p>But Murmur Goose-Egg hurried back to the castle
and asked for the reward the king had promised
him. And when the king hesitated and began to
make all sorts of excuses, in order not to have to
keep his promise, Murmur said it would be best to
have a substantial knapsackful of provisions made
ready, since now he, Murmur, was going to take his
reward himself. This the king did, and when the
knapsack was ready, Murmur took the king along
with him in front of the castle, and gave him a
proper shove, so that he flew high up into the air.
And he threw the knapsack up after him, so that
he would not be left altogether without provisions;
and if he has not come down yet, then he, together
with the knapsack, is floating between heaven and
earth to this very day.</p>

Gudbrandsdal, title and introduction after a variant from the vicinity
of Christiania) is predestined to great deeds from birth, like his
Swedish counterpart Knös. This giant fellow, who fears neither
death nor the devil, if he only has enough to eat, is of old a favorite
figure in Norse fairy-tale. It is by means of similar giant fooleries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
that Thor, the god of the Norwegian peasant, was made ridiculous,
and shown up as a braggart; and in the Song of Harbord he is
mocked because of his fondness for herring and mush, the very dish
Murmur demands before he crawls from the egg. Thor is also
credited with a trip to the nether world, just as Murmur is sent
to the devil in hell, to collect a tribute.</p>

<h2>XXIV<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE TROLL-WIFE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time, long, long years ago, there
lived a well-to-do old couple on a homestead
up in Hadeland. They had a son, who was a dragoon,
a big, handsome fellow. They had a pasture in
the hills, and the hut was not like most of the herdsmen&rsquo;s
huts; but was well and solidly built, and even
had a chimney, a roof and a window. And there
they spent the summer; but when they came back
home in the fall, the wood-cutters and huntsmen and
fishermen, and whoever else had business in the
woods at that time, noticed that the mountain folk
had carried on its tricks with their herd. And among
the mountain folk was a maiden who was so beautiful
that her like had never been seen.</p>

<p>The son had often heard tell of her, and one fall,
when his parents had already come home from the
mountain pasture, he put on his full uniform, saddled
his service horse, thrust his pistols in the holsters,
and thus rode up into the hills. When he
rode toward the pasture, such a fire burned in the
herdsman&rsquo;s hut that it lit up every road, and then
he knew that the mountain folk were inside. So he
tied his horse to a pine-tree, took a pistol from its
holster, crept up to the hut, and peeped through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
window. And there sat an old man and a woman
who were quite crooked and shriveled up with age,
and so unspeakably ugly that he had never seen anything
like it in his life; but with them was a maiden,
and she was so surpassingly beautiful that he fell in
love with her at once, and felt that he could not
live without her. All had cow&rsquo;s tails, and the lovely
maiden, too. And he could see that they had only
just arrived, for everything was in disorder. The
maiden was busy washing the ugly old man, and the
woman was building a fire under the great cheese-kettle
on the hearth.</p>

<p>At that moment the dragoon flung open the door,
and shot off his pistol right above the maiden&rsquo;s
head, so that she tottered and fell to the ground.
And then she grew every bit as ugly as she had been
beautiful before, and she had a nose as long as a
pistol-case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you may take her, for now she belongs to
you!&rdquo; said the old man. But the dragoon stood as
though rooted to the spot; stood where he stood,
and could not take a single step, either forward or
backward. Then the old man began to wash the
girl; and she looked a little better; her nose was
only half its original size, and her ugly cow&rsquo;s tail
was tied back; but she was not as handsome, and
any one who said so would not have been telling the
truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now she is yours, my proud dragoon! Take her
up before you on your horse, and ride into town
and marry her. And you need only set the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
for us in the little room in the bake-house; for we
do not want to be with the other wedding-guests,&rdquo;
said the old monster, her father, &ldquo;but when the
dishes make the round, you can stop in where we
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not dare do anything else, and took her
up before him on his horse, and made ready to
marry her. But before she went to church, the bride
begged one of the bridesmaids to stand close behind
her, so that no one could see her tail fall off when
the priest joined their hands.</p>

<p>So the wedding was celebrated, and when the
dishes made the round, the bridegroom went out
into the room where the table had been set for the
old folk from the mountain. And at that time there
was nothing to be seen there; but after the wedding-guests
had gone, there was so much gold and silver,
and such a pile of money lying there, as he had
never seen together before.</p>

<p>For a long time all went well. Whenever guests
came, his wife laid the table for the old folk in the
bake-house, and on each occasion so much money
was left lying there, that before long they did not
know what to do with it all. But ugly she was, and
ugly she remained, and he was heartily weary of
her. So it was bound to happen that he sometimes
flew into a rage, and threatened her with cuffs and
blows. Once he wanted to go to town, and since it
was fall, and the ground already frozen, the horse
had first to be shod. So he went into the smithy&mdash;for
he himself was a notable farrier&mdash;but, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
what lie did, the horse-shoe was either too large or
too small, and would not fit at all. He had no other
horse at home, and he toiled away until noon and
on into the afternoon. &ldquo;Will you never make an
end of your shoeing?&rdquo; asked his wife. &ldquo;You are
not a very good husband; but you are a far worse
farrier. I see there is nothing left for me but to
go into the smithy myself and shoe the horse. This
shoe is too large, you should have made it smaller,
and that one is too small, you should have made it
larger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the smithy, and the first thing she
did was to take the horse-shoe in both hands and
bend it straight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, look at it,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that is how you
must do it.&rdquo; And with that she bent it together
again as though it were made of lead. &ldquo;Now hold
up the horse&rsquo;s leg,&rdquo; said she, and the horse-shoe
fitted to a hair, so that the best farrier could not
have bettered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a great deal of strength in your fingers,&rdquo;
said her husband, and he looked at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;What would
have happened to me had you been as strong? But
I love you far too dearly ever to use my strength
against you,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>And from that day on he was the best of husbands.</p>

say, the woman is kind and gentle beyond all reproach, while her

<h2>XXV<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE KING&rsquo;S HARES</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a man who lived in
the little back room. He had given up his
estate to the heir; but in addition he had three
sons, who were named Peter, Paul and Esben, who
was the youngest. All three hung around at home
and would not work, for they had it too easy, and
they thought themselves too good for anything like
work, and nothing was good enough for them.
Finally Peter once heard that the king wanted a
shepherd for his hares, and he told his father he
would apply for the position, as it would just suit
him, seeing that he wished to serve no one lower in
rank than the king. His father, it is true, was of
the opinion that there might be other work that
would suit him better, for whoever was to herd
hares would have to be quick and spry, and not a
sleepy-head, and when the hares took to their heels
in all directions, it was a dance of another kind than
when one skipped about a room. But it was of no
use. Peter insisted, and would have his own way,
took his knapsack, and shambled down hill. After
he had gone a while, he saw an old woman who had
got her nose wedged in a tree-stump while chopping
wood, and when Peter saw her jerking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
pulling away, trying to get out, he burst into loud
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there and laugh in such a stupid
way,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but come and help a poor,
feeble old woman. I wanted to split up some fire-wood,
and caught my nose here, and here I have
been standing for more than a hundred years, pulling
and jerking, without a bit of bread to chew in
all that time,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Then Peter had to laugh all the harder. He found
it all very amusing, and said that if she had already
been standing there a hundred years, then she could
probably hold out for another hundred years or
more.</p>

<p>When he came to court they at once took him on
as a herdsman. The place was not bad, there was
good food, and good wages, and the chance of winning
the princess besides; yet if no more than a
single one of the king&rsquo;s hares were to be lost, they
would cut three red strips from his back, and throw
him into the snake-pit.</p>

<p>As long as Peter was on the common or in the
enclosure, he kept his hares together nicely, but
later, when they reached the forest, they ran away
from him across the hills. Peter ran after them
with tremendous leaps, as long as he thought he
could catch even a single hare, but when the very
last one had vanished, his breath was gone, and he
saw no more of them. Toward noon he went home,
taking his time about it, and when he reached the
enclosure, he looked around for them on all sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but no hares came. And then, when he came to the
castle, there stood the king with the knife in his hand.
He cut three red strips from his back, and cast him
into the snake-pit.</p>

<p>After a while Paul decided to go to the castle and
herd the king&rsquo;s hares. His father told him what he
had told Peter, and more besides; but he insisted
on going, and would not listen, and he fared neither
better nor worse than Peter had. The old woman
stood and pulled and jerked at her nose in the tree-trunk,
and he laughed, found it very amusing, and
let her stand there and torment herself. He was
at once taken into service, but the hares all ran
away across the hills, though he pursued them, and
worked away like a shepherd dog in the sun, and
when he came back to the castle in the evening minus
his hares, there stood the king with the knife in his
hand, cut three broad strips from his back, rubbed
in pepper and salt, and flung him into the snake-pit.</p>

<p>Then, after some time had passed, the youngest
decided to set out to herd the king&rsquo;s hares, and told
his father of his intention. He thought that would
be just the work for him, to loaf about in forest
and field, look for strawberry patches, herd a flock
of hares, and lie down and sleep in the sun between
times. His father thought that there was other work
that would suit him better, and that even if he fared
no worse than his brothers, it was quite certain that
he would fare no better. Whoever herded the king&rsquo;s
hares must not drag along as though he had lead
in his soles, or like a fly on a limerod; and that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the hares took to their heels, it was a horse of another
color from catching flees with gloved hands;
whoever wanted to escape with a whole back, would
have to be more than quick and nimble, and swifter
than a bird. But there was nothing he could do.
Esben merely kept on saying that he wanted to go
to court and serve the king, for he would not take
service with any lesser master, said he; and he
would see to the hares, they could not be much
worse than a herd of goats or of calves. And with
that he took his knapsack and strolled comfortably
down the hill.</p>

<p>After he had wandered a while, and began to feel
a proper hunger, he came to the old woman who was
wedged by the nose in the tree-trunk and who was
pulling and jerking away, in order to get loose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day, mother,&rdquo; said Esben, &ldquo;and why are
you worrying yourself so with your nose, you poor
thing?&rdquo; &ldquo;No one has called me mother for the last
hundred years,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;but come and
help me out, and give me a bite to eat; for I have
not had a bit to eat in all that time. And I will
do something for your sake as well,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Yes, no doubt she would need something to eat
and drink badly, said Esben.</p>

<p>Then he hewed the tree-trunk apart, so that she
got her nose out of the cleft, sat down to eat, and
shared with her. The old woman had a good appetite,
and she received a good half of his provisions.</p>

<p>When they were through she gave Esben a whistle
which had the power that if he blew into one end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
whatever he wished scattered was scattered to all
the winds, and when he blew into the other, all came
together again. And if the whistle passed from
his possession, it would return as soon as he wished
it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a wonderful whistle!&rdquo; thought Esben.</p>

<p>When he came to the castle, they at once took him
on as a shepherd; the place was not bad, he was
to have food and wages, and should he manage to
herd the king&rsquo;s hares without losing one of them,
he might possibly win the princess; but if he lost so
much as a single hare, and no matter how small it
might be, then they would cut three red strips from
his back, and the king was so sure of his case that
he went right off to whet his knife. It would be
a simple matter to herd the hares, thought Esben;
for when they went off they were as obedient as a
herd of sheep, and so long as they were on the common,
and in the enclosure, they even marched in
rank and file. But when they reached the forest,
and noon-time came, and the sun burned down on hill
and dale, they all took to their heels and ran away
across the hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, there! So you want to run away!&rdquo; called
Esben, and blew into one end of his whistle, and then
they scattered the more quickly to all the ends of the
earth. But when he had reached an old charcoal-pit,
he blew into the other end of his whistle, and
before he knew it the hares were back again, and
standing in rank and file so he could review them,
just like a regiment of soldiers on the drill-ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a splendid whistle!&rdquo; thought Esben; lay
down on a sunny hillock, and fell asleep. The hares
were left to their own devices, and played until evening;
then he once more whistled them together,
and took them along to the castle like a herd of
sheep.</p>

<p>The king and queen and the princess, too, stood in
the hall-way, and wondered what sort of a fellow
this was, who could herd hares without losing a
single one. The king reckoned and added them up,
and counted with his fingers, and then added them
up again; but not even the teeny-weeniest hare was
missing. &ldquo;He is quite a chap, he is,&rdquo; said the princess.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i006" id="i006"></a>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;THE KING RECKONED AND ADDED THEM UP, AND COUNTED
WITH HIS FINGERS.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="flr">&mdash;Page 207</span></span>
</div>

<p>The following day he again went to the forest, and
herded his hares; but while he lay in all comfort
beside a strawberry patch, they sent out the chamber-maid
from the castle to him, and she was to find
out how he managed to herd the king&rsquo;s hares.</p>

<p>He showed her his whistle, and blew into one
end, and all the hares darted away across the hills in
all directions, and then he blew into the other, and
they came trotting up from all sides, and once more
stood in rank and file. &ldquo;That is a wonderful whistle,&rdquo;
said the chamber-maid. She would gladly give
him a hundred dollars, if he cared to sell it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a splendid whistle,&rdquo; said Esben, &ldquo;and
I will not sell it for money. But if you give me a
hundred dollars, and a kiss with every dollar to
boot, then I might let you have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, that would suit her right down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
ground; she would gladly give him two kisses with
every dollar, and feel grateful, besides.</p>

<p>So she got the whistle, but when she reached the
castle, the whistle disappeared all of a sudden.
Esben had wished it back again, and toward evening
he came along, driving his hares like a herd
of sheep. The king reckoned and counted and added,
but all to no purpose, for not the least little hare was
missing.</p>

<p>When Esben was herding his hares the third day,
they sent the princess to him to get away his pipe
from him. She was tickled to death, and finally offered
him two hundred dollars if he would let her
have the whistle, and would also tell her what she
had to do in order to fetch it safely home with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a very valuable whistle,&rdquo; said Esben,
&ldquo;and I will not sell it,&rdquo; but at last, as a favor to
her, he said he would let her have it if she gave him
two hundred dollars, and a kiss for every dollar to
boot. But if she wanted to keep it, why, she must
take good care of it, for that was her affair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a very high price for a hare-whistle,&rdquo;
said the princess, and she really shrank from kissing
him, &ldquo;but since we are here in the middle of the
forest, where no one can see or hear us, I&rsquo;ll let it
pass, for I positively must have the whistle,&rdquo; said
she. And when Esben had pocketed the price agreed
upon, she received the whistle, and held it tightly
clutched in her hand all the way home; yet when she
reached the castle, and wanted to show it, it disappeared
out of her hands. On the following day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the queen herself set out, and she felt quite sure that
she would succeed in coaxing the whistle away from
him.</p>

<p>She was stingier, and only offered fifty dollars; but
she had to raise her bid until she reached three hundred.
Esben said it was a magnificent whistle, and
that the price was a beggarly one; but seeing that
she was the queen, he would let it pass. She was to
pay him three hundred dollars, and for every dollar
she was to give him a buss to boot, then she should
have the whistle. And he was paid in full as agreed,
since as regards the busses the queen was not so
stingy.</p>

<p>When she had the whistle in her hands, she tied
it fast, and hid it well, but she fared not a whit better
than either of the others; when she wanted to show
the whistle it was gone, and in the evening Esben
came home, driving his hares as though they were
a well-trained flock of sheep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are stupid women!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I suppose
I will have to go to him myself if we really are
to obtain this trumpery whistle. There seems to be
nothing else left to do!&rdquo; And the following day,
when Esben was once more herding his hares, the
king followed him, and found him at the same place
where the women had bargained with him.</p>

<p>They soon became good friends, and Esben showed
him the whistle, and blew into one end and the other,
and the king thought the whistle very pretty, and
finally insisted on buying it, even though it cost him
a thousand dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a magnificent whistle,&rdquo; said Esben,
&ldquo;and I would not sell it for money. But do you see
that white mare over yonder?&rdquo; said he, and pointed
into the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she belongs to me, that is my Snow Witch!&rdquo;
cried the king, for he knew her very well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you will give me a thousand dollars, and
kiss the white mare that is grazing on the moor by
the big pine, to boot, then you can have my whistle!&rdquo;
said Esben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the only price at which you will sell?&rdquo;
asked the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at least may I not put a silken handkerchief
between?&rdquo; asked the king.</p>

<p>This was conceded him, and thus he obtained the
whistle. He put it in the purse in his pocket, and
carefully buttoned up the pocket. Yet when he
reached the castle, and wanted to take it out, he was
in the same case as the women, for he no longer had
the whistle. And in the evening Esben came home
with his herd of hares, and not the least little hare
was missing.</p>

<p>The king was angry, and furious because he had
made a fool of them all, and had swindled the king&rsquo;s
self out of the whistle into the bargain, and now he
wanted to do away with Esben. The queen was
of the same opinion, and said it was best to
behead such a knave when he was caught in the
act.</p>

<p>Esben thought this neither fair nor just; for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
had only done what he had been asked to do, and had
defended himself as best he knew how.</p>

<p>But the king said that this made no difference to
him; yet if Esben could manage to fill the big brewing-cauldron
till it ran over, he would spare his life.</p>

<p>The job would be neither long nor hard, said
Esben, he thought he could warrant that, and he began
to tell about the old woman with her nose in
the tree-trunk, and in between he said, &ldquo;I must make
up plenty of stories, to fill the cauldron,&rdquo;&mdash;and then
he told of the whistle, and the chamber-maid who
came to him and wanted to buy the whistle for a
hundred dollars, and about all the kisses that she
had had to give him to boot, up on the hillock by
the forest; and then he told about the princess, how
she had come and kissed him so sweetly for the
whistle&rsquo;s sake, because no one could see or hear it
in the forest&mdash;&ldquo;I must make up plenty of stories,
in order to fill the cauldron,&rdquo; said Esben. Then he
told of the queen, and of how stingy she had been
with her money, and how liberal with her busses&mdash;&ldquo;for
I must make up plenty of stories in order to
fill the cauldron,&rdquo; said Esben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think it must be full now!&rdquo; said the queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, not a sign of it!&rdquo; said the king.</p>

<p>Then Esben began to tell how the king had come
to him, and about the white mare who was grazing on
the moor, &ldquo;and since he insisted on having the whistle
he had to&mdash;he had to&mdash;well, with all due respect,
I have to make up plenty of stories in order to fill
the cauldron,&rdquo; said Esben.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop! It is full, fellow!&rdquo; cried the king.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that it is running over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king and the queen were of the opinion that
it would be best for Esben to receive the princess
and half the kingdom; there did not seem anything
else to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a magnificent whistle!&rdquo; said Esben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Hares&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen, N.F.E., p.&nbsp;190, No.&nbsp;98. After
different variants from Röken, Aadal, Bier and Asker, Riugerike and
Hardanger) is the story of the cauldron full of lies, which has probably
found special favor in Norway because of its outcome, not very
flattering for the king and queen. It is noticeable that in Northern
fairy-tales those kings who will not give up their daughters to the
heroes at any cost are handled with considerable disrespect.</p>

<h2>XXVI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">HELGE-HAL IN THE BLUE HILL</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a sinister old
couple, who lived out under the open sky. All
that they had were three sons, an old cook-pot, an
old frying-pan, and an old cat. Then the man died,
and after a time his wife died, too. Now their estate
was to be divided. So the oldest took the old cook-pot,
and the second took the old frying-pan, and Ebe
Ashpeter had no choice. He had to take the old cat,
and they did not ask him whether he wanted to or
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother Peter can scrape out the cook-pot after
he has loaned it out,&rdquo; said Ebe. &ldquo;Brother Paul gets
a crust of bread when he lends out his frying-pan;
but what am I to do with this wretched cat?&rdquo; And
he was angry and envious. Yet he scratched the
cat and stroked it, and this pleased the cat so that
she began to purr, and raised her tail in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, I&rsquo;ll help you yet,&rdquo; said the cat,
&ldquo;wait, wait, I&rsquo;ll help you yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing to bite or break in the hut.
Brother Peter and Brother Paul had each of them
gone off in a different direction. So Ebe set out, too,
with the cat in the lead, himself following; but after
a time he turned and went home again, to see
whether the floor had been swept, and the cat tripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
on alone. After she had gone her way, tipp, tapp,
tipp, tapp, for a while, she came to a great rock,
and there she met an enormous herd of reindeer.
The cat crept softly around the herd, and then with
one leap sprang between the horns of the finest
buck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not go where I want you to, I&rsquo;ll
scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock
and precipice!&rdquo; said she. So the buck did not dare
do anything save what the cat wished, and off they
went over stick and stone, from cliff to cliff, close
by Ebe, who was just polishing the door-sill of his
house, and with one bound right into the castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and
ask whether my lord king might care to have this
buck reindeer to drive,&rdquo; said the cat. Yes, he could
make good use of such a young, handsome animal,
some time, when he had occasion to drive out to visit
a neighboring king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Ebe must be a proud and powerful lord,&rdquo;
said the king, &ldquo;if he can make me such presents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is the greatest lord in all your land and
kingdom,&rdquo; said the cat, but no matter how many
questions the king asked, he learned nothing more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him that I am much obliged,&rdquo; said the king,
and he sent him a whole cart-load of handsome presents.
But Ebe looked past them and paid no attention
to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother Peter can scrape out his cook-pot when
he has loaned it out, and Brother Paul gets a crust
of bread when he lends out his frying-pan; but what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
am I to do with this wretched cat!&rdquo; said he, and felt
angry and envious; but still he scratched the cat, and
stroked her, and this pleased her so much that she
began to purr, and raised her tail in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, I will help you yet,&rdquo; said the cat,
&ldquo;wait, wait, I will help you yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day they both set out again, the cat in
the lead, and Ebe following. After a while he turned
back to see whether the folding-table at home had
been scoured. And the cat tripped on alone. After
she had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a
while, she came to a dense forest slope. There she
found an enormous herd of elk. The cat crept softly
up, and suddenly there she sat between the horns of
one of the stateliest of the bull elks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not go where I want you to, I will
scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and
precipice!&rdquo; said the cat. The elk did not dare do
anything save what the cat wished, and so off they
went, like lightning, over stick and stone, from cliff
to cliff, right past Ebe, who stood before the house
scouring the shutters, and with one bound into the
king&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and
ask whether my lord king might not care to have
this bull elk for courier service.&rdquo; It was quite clear
that should the king want a swift messenger, some
time, he could not find a swifter in all his kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Ebe must be a most distinguished lord, since
he finds such presents for me,&rdquo; said the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, one might call him a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
lord,&rdquo; said the cat, &ldquo;his wealth is without end or
limit.&rdquo; But no matter how many other questions the
king asked, he received no more explicit information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him that I am much obliged, and to do me
the honor to call when he is passing here some
time,&rdquo; said the king, and sent him a robe as handsome
as the one he himself was wearing, and three
cartloads of handsome presents. But Ebe did not
even want to put on the royal robe, and hardly
looked at the other presents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother Peter can scrape out his cook-pot when
he has loaned it out, Brother Paul gets a crust of
bread when he lends out his frying-pan; but of what
use is this wretched cat to me!&rdquo; he said, in spite
of all. Yet he stroked the cat, and pressed her to
his cheek, and scratched her, and this pleased the
cat so very much that she purred more than on the
other occasions, and stuck her tail up into the air as
straight as a rod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, I will help you yet,&rdquo; said the cat,
&ldquo;wait, wait, I will help you yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the third day they set out again, the cat in the
lead, and Ebe following. After a time it occurred
to him to go back and let the mice out of the house,
so that they would not be altogether starved in the
old hut; and the cat tripped on alone. After she
had gone her way, tipp, tapp, tipp, tapp, for a while,
she came to a dense pine forest, and there she met
a father bear, a mother bear and a baby bear. The
cat crept softly up to them, and all at once she was
hanging by her claws to the father bear&rsquo;s head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not go where I want you to, I will
scratch out your eyes, and drive you over rock and
precipice!&rdquo; said the cat, and spit and arched her
back. Then the father bear did not dare do anything
save what the cat wished, and now they dashed
past Ebe, who had just carried all the young mice
over the threshold, like a storm, over stick and stone,
from cliff to cliff, so that the earth trembled and
shook. The king was just standing in the hallway,
and was not a little surprised to see such guests
arriving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to deliver a kind greeting from Ebe, and
ask whether my lord king might not care to have
this bear for a general or royal counselor,&rdquo; said the
cat. The king was more than pleased to secure such
a creature for his nearest adviser, who could
doubt it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him that I am much obliged, but that I do
not at all know how to show my appreciation,&rdquo; said
the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he would like to marry your youngest
daughter!&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that is asking a good deal,&rdquo; said the
king. &ldquo;He really ought to pay me a visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ebe does not enter such plain houses,&rdquo; said the
cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he a handsomer castle than this?&rdquo; asked
the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Handsomer? Why, your castle seems like the
shabbiest hut in comparison with his!&rdquo; was the cat&rsquo;s
reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare come into my presence, and tell me
that there is some one living in my kingdom who
is more handsomely housed than I, the king!&rdquo;
shouted the king, beside himself with rage. He came
near wringing the cat&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might wait until you see it,&rdquo; said the cat.
And the king said yes, he would wait. &ldquo;But if you
have told me a falsehood, you shall die, and though
you had seven lives,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>In the morning the king and the whole court set
out to travel to Ebe Ashpeter&rsquo;s castle. The cat was
in the little hut, and called for Ebe, thinking it would
be best if both of them got underway an hour earlier.
After they had gone a while, they met some
folk who were herding sheep; and the sheep were
bleating and grazing over the whole plain. They
were as large as full-grown calves, and their wool
was so long that it dragged along the ground after
them. &ldquo;To whom do the sheep belong?&rdquo; asked the
cat. &ldquo;To Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,&rdquo; said the
shepherds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The court is coming past in a moment,&rdquo; said
the cat, &ldquo;and if then you do not at once say that
they belong to Ebe, I will scratch out your eyes, and
drive you over rock and precipice!&rdquo; said the cat,
and spat and arched her back, and showed her teeth.
Then the shepherds were so frightened that they
at once promised to do as the cat had ordered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to whom do all these sheep belong?&rdquo; asked
the king, when he came by with the court somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
later. &ldquo;They are every bit as handsome as my
own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They belong to Ebe,&rdquo; said the shepherds.</p>

<p>Then the cat and Ebe wandered on for a while, and
came to a dense forest slope. There they met folk
who were tending goats. The goats skipped and
leaped about everywhere, and gave such fine milk
that better could no where be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom do the goats belong?&rdquo; asked the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,&rdquo; said the herdsmen.
Then the cat again went through her ferocious
preparations, and the herdsmen were so frightened
that they did not dare oppose her wishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now who in the world can be the owner of so
many goats?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;I myself have none
finer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They belong to Ebe,&rdquo; said the herdsmen.</p>

<p>Then they wandered on for a while, and met folk
who were tending cows: wherever one looked the
cows lowed and glistened, and each yielded milk
enough for three. When the cat heard that these
herdsmen were also in the service of Helge-Hal of
the Blue Hill, she spat once more, and arched her
back, and then all the herdsmen were ready that
moment to say what she wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in heaven&rsquo;s name, to whom do all these
beautiful cattle belong?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;There
are no such cattle in my whole kingdom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They belong to Lord Ebe,&rdquo; said the herdsmen.</p>

<p>Then they wandered on for a long, long time. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
last they came to a great plain, and there they met
horse-herders; and horses whinnied and disported
themselves over the whole plain, and their coats were
so fine that they glistened as though gilded, and each
horse was worth a whole castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For whom do you herd these horses?&rdquo; asked the
cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill,&rdquo; the herders
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the court will come by here in a little
while,&rdquo; said the cat, &ldquo;and if you do not say you
are herding them for Ebe, I will scratch out your
eyes, and drive you over rock and precipice!&rdquo; said
the cat, and she spat, and showed her teeth and claws,
and grew so angry her hair stood up all along her
back. Then the herders were terribly frightened,
and did not dare do anything but what the cat
wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in the name of heaven, to whom do all these
horses belong?&rdquo; asked the king, when he came by
with his court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They belong to Ebe,&rdquo; said the herders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never have seen or heard anything like it in
all my life!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;This Ebe is such a
distinguished lord that it is past my understanding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cat and Ebe had long since gone on their way,
and had wandered far and ever farther over hill and
rock. In the evening, at dusk, they came to a royal
castle that glittered and shimmered as though it
were of the purest silver and gold&mdash;which it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Yet it was gloomy and depressing, and lonely and
barren there, and nowhere was there a sign of life.</p>

<p>Here they went in, and the cat stood with a cake
of rye meal just below the door. Suddenly there
came a thundering and a thumping so that the earth
trembled, and the whole castle shook, and that was
the troll who was coming home. And suddenly all
was quiet again, and before they knew it, Helge-Hal
in the Blue Hill had thrust his three great horrible
heads in at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me in! Let me in!&rdquo; he cried, so that every
one shivered. &ldquo;Wait, wait a bit while I tell you
what the rye had to go through before he was made
into this cake,&rdquo; said the cat, and spoke to him in the
sweetest way. &ldquo;First he was threshed, and then he
was beaten, and then he was pounded, and then he
was thumped, and then he was thrown from one wall
to another, and then he was sifted through a
sieve....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me in! Let me in, you chatterbox!&rdquo; cried
the troll, and he was so furious that the sparks flew
from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, wait a bit. I will tell you what the
rye had to go through before he was made into this
cake!&rdquo; said the cat, and he spoke to him still more
sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First he was threshed, and then he was beaten,
and then he was pounded, and then he was thumped,
and then he was thrown from one wall to another,
and then he was sifted through a sieve, and shaken
here and there, and then he was put on the drying-board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and then in the stove, until it grew so hot
that he puffed up more and more, and wanted to
get out, but could not,&rdquo; said the cat, and took her
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way and let me in!&rdquo; cried the
troll once more, and nearly burst with rage; but the
cat acted as though she did not hear him, and talked
down the blue from the sky, and went up and down
the while, and whenever the troll tried to come in,
she met him beneath the door with the cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, but do take a look at the shining maiden coming
up there behind the mountain!&rdquo; said the cat,
after she had talked at length about the sufferings
of the rye. And Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill turned
his three heads around in order to see the beautiful
maiden, too. Then the sun rose, and the troll stiffened
into stone. Now Ebe obtained all the riches
that the troll had possessed, the sheep and goats,
the cows and all the spirited horses, and the handsome
golden castle, and some big bags of money besides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here come the king and all his court,&rdquo; said the
cat. &ldquo;Just go out before the door and receive
them!&rdquo; So Ebe got up and went to meet them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are indeed a very distinguished lord!&rdquo; said
the king to him. &ldquo;So far as I am concerned you may
have the youngest princess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they started brewing and baking on a large
scale in the greatest haste, and everything was made
ready for the wedding. On the first day of the feast
the cat came and begged the bridegroom to cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
her head. This he did not at all want to do; but the
cat spat and showed her teeth, and then Ebe did not
dare disobey her. But when the head fell to the
ground, the cat turned into a most handsome prince.
He married the second princess, and as the wedding
procession was on its way to church, they met a
third prince who was looking for a wife, and he took
the oldest princess. Then they all three celebrated
their weddings so that the story went the rounds in
twelve kingdoms.</p>

<p>The tale of &ldquo;Helge-Hal in the Blue Hill&rdquo; (Bergh, No.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;19) is
delightfully told. There is the timid, abidingly helpless nit-wit, and
the wise and energetic cat, who is quite at home in the ancient
wisdom that enables her to render trolls harmless. Their attention
must be held through the night by means of some pretext, a meaningless
tale, for instance, until the first ray of the rising sun falls
on them, when they turn to stone, or have to burst. In the Edda
this is what happens to the dwarf Alvis, so full of sinister lore.</p>

<h2>XXVII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE LORD OF THE HILL AND JOHN BLESSOM</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">John Blessom</span> once upon a time had gone
down to Copenhagen to carry on a suit at law,
for in those days one could not get justice in the
land of Norroway; and if a man wanted his rights,
there was nothing left for him to do but to travel
to Copenhagen. This is what Blessom had done,
and what his son did after him, for he, too, carried
on a law-suit. Now it chanced that on Christmas
Eve John had had speech with the gentleman in
authority, and had attended to his business, and was
going along the street in a low-spirited manner, for
he was homesick. And as he went along, a man
from Vaage, in a white blouse, with a knapsack, and
buttons as big as silver dollars, passed him. He was
a large, heavily-built man. It seemed to Blessom
that he must know him; but he was walking very
fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are walking very fast,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but then I&rsquo;m in a hurry,&rdquo; answered the
man. &ldquo;I have to get back to Vaage this very evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish that I could get there!&rdquo; sighed John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can stand on the runner of my sledge,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;for I have a horse that covers a mile in
twelve steps.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>So they set out, and Blessom had all that he could
do to hold fast to the runner of the sledge; for they
went through weather and wind, and he could see
neither heaven nor earth.</p>

<p>Once they stopped and rested. He could not tell
exactly where it was, but when they began to hurry
on again, he thought that he spied a skull on a pole.
After they had gone on a while, John Blessom began
to freeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, I forgot one of my gloves where we
stopped, and now my hand is freezing!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Blessom, you&rsquo;ll have to make the best of
it,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;We are not far from Vaage
now. When we stopped to rest we had covered half
the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they crossed the Finnebridge, the man
stopped and set John down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you are not far from home,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
you must promise me that you will not look around,
when you hear a roaring and notice a flare of light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John promised, and thanked him for the quick
journey. The man drove off on his way, and John
crossed the hill to his home. As he went he heard
a roaring in the Jutulsberg, and the path before him
suddenly grew so bright that one could have picked
a needle from the ground. And he forgot what he
had promised, and turned his head to see what was
happening. There stood the giant gate of the
Jutulsberg wide open, and out of it streamed a light
and radiance as of thousands of candles. In the
midst of it all stood the giant, and he was the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with whom he had driven. But from that time forward
John&rsquo;s head was twisted, and so it remained
as long as he lived.</p>

<h2>XXVIII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE YOUNG FELLOW AND THE DEVIL</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a young fellow, who
was going along cracking nuts. He found a
wormy one, and at the selfsame moment he met the
devil. &ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; said the young fellow, &ldquo;that the
devil can make himself as small as he likes, and can
slip through the eye of a needle, as the people say?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the devil. &ldquo;Well, I should certainly
like to see you crawl into that nut!&rdquo; said the
young fellow. The devil did so. But when he had
crawled through the hole, the young fellow stopped
it up with a bit of wood. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; said
he, and put the nut in his pocket. After he had gone
a while, he came to a smithy, and went in and asked
the smith to break the nut for him. &ldquo;Why, that is
a mere trifle!&rdquo; said the smith, took his smallest
hammer, laid the nut on the anvil, and struck it; but
the nut would not break. Then he took a somewhat
larger hammer; but that was not heavy enough
either. Then he took a still larger one, but could do
nothing with it at all, and thereupon he grew angry,
and took his heaviest hammer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break you
yet!&rdquo; said he, and struck it with all his might. And
then the nut cracked, so that half the smithy roof
was carried away, and there was a crash as though
the whole hut were falling in. &ldquo;I believe the devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
was in that nut!&rdquo; said the smith. &ldquo;And so he was!&rdquo;
answered the young fellow.</p>

<p>This getting the better of the devil, as in &ldquo;The Young Fellow and
the Devil&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen and Moe, N.F.E., p.&nbsp;133, No.&nbsp;30), already
occurs in the fairy-tale from the &ldquo;Thousand and One Nights,&rdquo; where
a spirit slips, not into a nut, but into a bottle, in order to show
what he can do. Ibsen, too, allows Per Gynt to dwell on this fairy-tale.</p>

<h2>XXIX<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">FARTHER SOUTH THAN SOUTH, AND FARTHER
NORTH THAN NORTH, AND IN THE GREAT
HILL OF GOLD</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a peasant who had
a wheat-field, which was trampled down every
Saturday night. Now the peasant had three sons,
and he told each one of them to spend a Saturday
night in the field, and to watch and see who trampled
it down. The oldest was to make the first trial. So
he lay down by the upper ridge of the field, and
after he had lain there a while he fell asleep. The
following morning the whole field had been trampled
down, and the young fellow was unable to tell how it
had happened.</p>

<p>Now the second son was to make the attempt; but
he had the same experience. After he had lain a
while he fell asleep, and in the morning he was unable
to tell how the field had come to be trampled
down.</p>

<p>Now it was the turn of John by the Ashes. He
did not lie down by the upper ridge of the field; but
lower down, and stayed awake. After he had lain
there a while, three doves came flying along. They
settled in the field, and that very moment shook off
all their feathers, and turned into the most beautiful
maidens one might wish to see. They danced with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
each other over the whole field; and while they did
so, the young fellow gathered up all their feathers.
Toward morning they wanted to put on their feathers
again, but could not find them anywhere. Then
they were frightened, and wept and searched and
searched and wept. Finally, they discovered the
young fellow, and begged him to give them back their
feathers. &ldquo;But why do you dance in our wheat-field?&rdquo;
said the young fellow. &ldquo;Alas, it is not our
fault,&rdquo; said the maidens. &ldquo;The troll who has enchanted
us sends us here every Saturday night to
trample the field. But now give us our feathers, for
morning is near.&rdquo; And they begged for them in the
sweetest way. &ldquo;I do not know about that,&rdquo; said the
young fellow, &ldquo;you have trampled down the field so
very badly; perhaps&mdash;if I might choose and have one
of you?&rdquo; &ldquo;That would please us,&rdquo; returned the
maidens, &ldquo;but it would not be possible; for three
trolls guard us, one with three, one with six and one
with nine heads, and they kill all who come to the
mountain.&rdquo; But the young fellow said that one of
them pleased him so very much that he would make
the attempt, in spite of what they had told him. So
he chose the middle one, for she seemed the most
beautiful to him, and she gave him a ring and put it
on his finger. And then the maidens at once put on
their garments of dove feathers, and flew back across
forest and hill.</p>

<p>When the young fellow returned home, he told
what he had seen. &ldquo;And now I must set out and try
my luck,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I do not know whether I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
return, but I must make the venture.&rdquo; &ldquo;O John,
John by the Ashes!&rdquo; said his brothers, and laughed
at him. &ldquo;Well, it makes no difference, even though I
am worthless,&rdquo; said John by the Ashes. &ldquo;I must
try my luck.&rdquo; So the young fellow set out to
wander to the place where the maidens lived. They
had told him it was farther south than south, and
farther north than north, in the great hill of gold.
After he had gone a while, he met two poor lads who
were quarreling with each other about a pair of old
shoes and a bamboo cane, which their mother had
left them. The young fellow said it was not worth
quarreling about such things, and that he had better
shoes and better canes at home. &ldquo;You cannot say
that,&rdquo; returned the brothers, &ldquo;for whoever has these
shoes on can cover a thousand miles in a single step,
and whatever is touched with this cane must die at
once.&rdquo; The young fellow went on to ask whether
they would sell the things. They said that they ought
to get a great deal for them. &ldquo;But what you say
of them is not true at all,&rdquo; the young fellow replied.
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, it is absolutely true,&rdquo; they answered.
&ldquo;Just let me see whether the boots will fit me,&rdquo; said
the young fellow. So they let him try them on. But
no sooner did the young fellow have the boots on
his feet, and the cane in his hand, than he took a
step and off he was, a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>A little later he met two young fellows who were
quarreling over an old fiddle, which had been left
them. &ldquo;Now is that worth while doing?&rdquo; said the
young fellow. &ldquo;I have a brand-new fiddle at home.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I doubt if it has such a tone as ours,&rdquo; said one
of the youths, &ldquo;for if some one is dead, and you
play this fiddle, he will come to life again.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
really is a good deal,&rdquo; said the young fellow. &ldquo;May
I draw the bow across the strings?&rdquo; They told him
he might, but no sooner did he have the fiddle in his
hand than he took a step, and suddenly he was a
thousand miles away.</p>

<p>A little later he met an old man, and him he asked
whether he knew where the place might be that was
&ldquo;farther south than south, and farther north than
north, and in the great hill of gold.&rdquo; The man said
yes, he knew well enough, but it would not do the
young fellow much good to get there, for the troll
who lived there killed every one. &ldquo;O, I have to
make the attempt, whether it lead to life or death,&rdquo;
said the young fellow, for he was fonder than fond
of the middle one of the three maidens. So he
learned the way from the old man, and finally
reached the hill. There he had to pass through three
rooms, before he came into the hall to the maidens.
And there were locks on every door, and at each
stood a watchman. &ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo;
asked the first watchman. &ldquo;In to the maidens,&rdquo;
said the young fellow. &ldquo;In you may go, but you&rsquo;ll
not get out again,&rdquo; said the watchman, &ldquo;for now the
troll will be along before long.&rdquo; But the young
fellow said that, at any rate, he would make the attempt,
and went on. So he came to the second
watchman. &ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo; asked the
latter. &ldquo;In to the maidens,&rdquo; said the young fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&ldquo;In you may go, but you&rsquo;ll not get out again,&rdquo; said
the watchman, &ldquo;for the troll will be here any minute.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And yet I will make the attempt,&rdquo; said the
young fellow, and the watchman let him pass. So he
came to the third watchman. &ldquo;Where do you want
to go?&rdquo; the latter asked him. &ldquo;In to the maidens,&rdquo;
said the young fellow. &ldquo;In you may go, but you&rsquo;ll
never get out again, for the troll will be here in
three shakes of a lamb&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; said the watchman.
&ldquo;And yet I will make the attempt,&rdquo; said the young
fellow, and this watchman also let him pass. Then
he reached the inner chamber where the maidens sat.
They were so beautiful and distinguished, and the
room was so full of gold and silver, that the young
fellow never could have imagined anything like it.
Then he showed the ring, and asked whether the
maidens recognized it. Indeed they did recognize
him and the ring. &ldquo;But you poor unfortunate, this
is the end of us and of you!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;The troll
with three heads will be along before long, and you
had better hide behind the door!&rdquo; &ldquo;O, I&rsquo;m so
frightened, I&rsquo;m so frightened!&rdquo; wailed the maiden
whom the young fellow had chosen. &ldquo;Just you stop
crying,&rdquo; said the young fellow. &ldquo;I think fortune
will favor us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The troll came that very moment and thrust his
three heads into the door. &ldquo;Uff, it smells like Christian
blood here!&rdquo; said he. The young fellow struck
at the heads with his bamboo cane, and the troll
was dead in a minute. So they carried out the body
and hid it. A little later the troll with six heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
came home. &ldquo;Uff, it smells like Christian blood
here!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Some one must have crept into the
place! But what has become of the other troll?&rdquo;
said he, when he did not see the troll with three
heads. &ldquo;He has not yet come home,&rdquo; said the
maidens. &ldquo;He must have come home,&rdquo; said the
troll. &ldquo;Perhaps he has gone to look for the fellow
who crept in here.&rdquo; At that moment the young
fellow struck all six of his heads with his bamboo
cane, and the troll at once fell dead to the ground.
Then they dragged out the corpse.</p>

<p>A while later came the troll with nine heads.
&ldquo;Uff, it smells like Christian blood here!&rdquo; said he,
and grew very angry. &ldquo;But where are the two
others?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They have not yet come home,&rdquo;
said the maidens. &ldquo;Indeed they have come,&rdquo; said
the troll, &ldquo;but they are probably looking for the
Christian who has crept in here!&rdquo; At that moment,
the young fellow sprang from behind the door, and
struck one head after another with his bamboo cane.
But he had no more than reached the eighth than
it seemed to him that the troll was getting the upper
hand, and he ran out of the door. The troll was
so furious that he came near bursting. He seized
all the maidens and killed them, and then out he
flew after the young fellow. The latter had hidden
behind a big rock, and when the troll came darting
up, showering sparks in his rage, he struck at his
ninth head, too, and the troll fell on his back, dead.
Then the young fellow ran in again, took his fiddle
and played, and all the maidens came back to life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Now they wanted to go home; but did not know how
to find the long road back. &ldquo;I know what we must
do,&rdquo; said the young fellow, &ldquo;I will take you on my
back, one by one, and then the journey will not be
long for us.&rdquo; And this he did. He carried home
all the gold and silver he found in the hill, and then
celebrated his wedding with the middle one of the
maidens, and if they have not died, they are living
this very day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farther South Than South, and Farther North Than North, and
in the Great Hill of Gold&rdquo; (Janson, No.&nbsp;12, p.&nbsp;39) begins with the
story of three maidens in feather dress who have to keep their
human form if robbed of their feathers. The legend of Wieland and
Smith introduces three similar maidens in swan&rsquo;s plumage, one
of whom he wins for himself; yet when she finds her swan dress
again after long years, yearning overpowers her, and she flies away.
Our fairy-tale is kindlier, and allows the young fellow to gain his
dove princess after strenuous adventures.</p>

<h2>XXX<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">LUCKY ANDREW</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a rich peasant who had two
sons, named John Nicholas and Lucky Andrew.
The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one
never can quite make head or tail. He was a most
unpleasant customer to deal with, and he was more
grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland
are, as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them
unblessed with these attractive qualities. The other,
Lucky Andrew, was wild and high spirited, but always
good natured, and no matter how badly off he
might be, he would always insist that he had been
born under a lucky star. When the eagle, in order
to defend his nest, belabored his head and face till
the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was
born under a lucky star, if only he managed to bring
home a single eaglet. Did his boat capsize, which
occasionally happened, and did they discover him
hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold
and exertion, and asked him how he felt, he would
reply: &ldquo;O, quite well. I have been saved. I surely
am in luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When their father died, both of them were of
age, and not long after they both had to go out to
the sand-banks to fetch some fishing-nets, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
been left there since the summer fishing. It was
late in the fall, after the time when most fishermen
are busy with the summer fishing. Andrew had his
gun along, which he carried with him wherever he
went. John Nicholas did not say much while they
were underway; but he thought all the harder. They
were not ready to set out for home again until near
evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark, Lucky Andrew, do you know there will be
a storm to-night?&rdquo; said John Nicholas, and looked
out across the sea. &ldquo;I think it would be best if we
stayed here until morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no storm,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;The
Seven Sisters have not put on their fog-caps, so you
may be quite at rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his brother complained of being weary, and
at length they decided to remain there for the night.
When Andrew awoke he found himself alone; and
he saw neither brother nor boat, until he came to
the highest point of the island. Then he discovered
him far out, darting for land like a sea-gull.
Andrew did not understand the whole affair. There
were still provisions there, as well as a dish of
curd, his gun and various other things. So Andrew
wasted but little time in thought. &ldquo;He will come
back this evening,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Only a fool loses
heart so long as he can eat.&rdquo; But in the evening
there was no brother to be seen, and Andrew waited
day by day, and week by week; until at last, he
realized that his brother had marooned him on this
barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
for himself, and not have to divide it.
And such was the case, for when John Nicholas came
in sight of land on his homeward trip, he had capsized
the boat, and declared that Lucky Andrew had
been drowned.</p>

<p>But the latter did not lose heart. He gathered
drift-wood along the strand, shot sea-birds, and
looked for mussels and roots. He built himself a
raft of drift-timber, and fished with a pole that
had also been left behind. One day, while he was
at work, he happened to notice a depression or hollow
in the sand, as though made by the keel of a
large Northland schooner, and he could plainly trace
the braidings of the hawsers from the strand up to
the top of the island. Then he thought to himself
that he was in no danger, for he saw there was truth
in the report he had often heard, that the meer-folk
made the island their abode, and did much business
with their ships.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be praised for good company! That was
just what I needed. Yes, it is true, as I have always
said, that I was born under a lucky star,&rdquo; thought
Andrew to himself; perhaps he said so too, for occasionally
he really had to talk a little. So he lived
through the fall. Once he saw a boat, and hung a
rag on a pole and waved with it; but that very moment
the sail dropped, and the crew took to the
oars and rowed away at top speed, for they thought
the meer-trolls were making signs and waving.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and
music far out at sea; and when he came out, he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a glow of light that came from a great Northland
schooner, which was gliding toward the land&mdash;yet
such a ship he had never yet seen. It has a main-sail
of uncommon size, which looked to him to be of
silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though
woven of steel wire, and everything else was in proportion,
as fine and handsome as any Northlander
might wish to have. The whole schooner was filled
with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who
stood at the helm was adorned like a bride, and
looked as splendid as a queen, for she wore a crown
and costly garments. Yet any one could see that she
was a human being, for she was tall, and handsomer
than the meer-folk. In fact, Lucky Andrew thought
that she was handsomer than any girl he ever had
seen. The schooner headed for the land where Andrew
stood; but with his usual presence of mind, he
hurried to the fisherman&rsquo;s hut, pulled down his gun
from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and
hid himself, so that he could see all that passed in
the hut. He soon noticed that the whole room was
alive with people. They filled it completely and
more, and still more of them came in. Then the
walls began to crack, and the little hut spread out
at all corners, and grew so splendid and magnificent
that the wealthiest merchant could not have had
its equal; it was almost like being in a royal castle.
Tables were covered with the most exquisite silver
and gold. When they had eaten they began to dance.
Under cover of the noise, Andrew crept to the look-out
at the side of the roof, and climbed down. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
he ran to the schooner, threw his flint-stone over it,
and in order to make certain, cut a cross into it with
his sharp-cutting knife. When he came back again,
the dance was in full swing. The tables were dancing
and the benches and chairs&mdash;everything else in
the room was dancing, too. The only one who did
not dance was the bride; she only sat there and
looked on, and when the bridegroom came to fetch
her, she sent him away. For the moment there was
no thought of stopping. The fiddler knew neither
rest nor repose, and did not pass his cap, but played
merrily on with his left hand, and beat time with his
foot, until he was dripping with sweat, and the fiddle
was hidden by the dust and smoke. When Andrew
noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he
was standing, he thought to himself: &ldquo;Now I had
better shoot away, or else he will play me right off
the ground!&rdquo; So he turned his gun, thrust it
through the window, and shot it off over the bride&rsquo;s
head; but upside down, otherwise the bullet would
have hit him. The moment the shot crashed, all the
troll-folk tumbled out of the door together; but when
they saw that the schooner was banned on the shore,
they wailed and crept into a hole in the hill. But
all the gold and silver dishes were left behind, and
the bride, too, was still sitting there. She told
Lucky Andrew that she had been carried into the
hill when she was only a small child. Once, when
her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the
milking, she had taken her along; but when she had
to go home for a moment, she left the child sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
under a juniper-bush, and told her that she might
eat the berries if she only repeated three times:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;I eat juniper-berries blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein Jesu&rsquo;s cross I view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I eat whortle-berries red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since &rsquo;twas for my sake He bled!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But after her mother had gone, she found so many
berries that she forgot to say her verse, and so she
was enchanted and taken into the hill. And there
no harm had been done her, save that she had lost
the top joint of the little finger of her left hand, and
the goblins had been kind to her; yet it had always
seemed to her as though something were not as it
should be, she felt as though something weighed
upon her, and she had suffered greatly from the advances
of the dwarf who had been chosen for her
husband. When Andrew learned who her mother
and her people were, he saw that they were related
to him, and they became very good friends. So Andrew
could truly say he had been born under a lucky
star. Then they sailed home, and took along the
schooner, and all the gold and silver, and all the
treasure which had been left in the hut, and then
Andrew was far wealthier than his brother.</p>

<p>But the latter, who suspected where all this wealth
had come from, did not wish to be any poorer than
Andrew. He knew that trolls and goblins walk
mainly on Christmas Eve, and for that reason he
sailed out to the sand banks at that time. And on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Christmas Eve he did see a light or fire, but it
seemed to be like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps fluttering about.
When he came nearer he heard splashes, horrible
howls, and cold, piercing cries, and there was a smell
of slime and sea-weed, as at ebb-tide. Terrified, he
ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the
trolls on the shore. They were short and thick like
hay-ricks, completely covered with fur, with kirtles
of skins, fishing boots, and enormous fist-gloves. In
place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed.
When they crawled up from the strand there was a
gleam behind them like that of rotting wood, and
when they shook themselves they showered sparks
about them. When they drew nearer, John Nicholas
crawled up into the loft as his brother had done.
The goblins dragged a great stone into the hut, and
began to beat their gloves dry against it, and meanwhile
they screamed so that John Nicholas&rsquo;s blood
turned to ice in his hiding-place. Then one of them
sneezed into the ashes on the hearth in order to
make the fire burn again; while the others carried
in heather-grass and drift-wood, as coarse and heavy
as lead. The smoke and the heat nearly killed the
eavesdropper in the loft, and in order to catch his
breath and get some fresh air, he tried to crawl out
of the look-out in the roof; yet he was of much heavier
build than his brother, stuck fast and could move
neither in nor out. Then he grew frightened and
began to scream; but the goblins screamed much
louder, and roared and howled, and thumped and
clamored inside and outside the hut. But when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
cock crowed they disappeared, and John Nicholas
freed himself, too. Yet when he returned home from
his trip, he had lost his reason, and after that the
same cold, sinister screams which are the mark of
the troll in the Northland, might often be heard
sounding from store-rooms and lofts where he happened
to be. Before his death, however, his reason
returned, and he was buried in consecrated ground,
as they say. But after that time no human foot
ever trod the sand-banks again. They sank, and the
meer-folk, it is believed, went to the Lekang Islands.
Andrew&rsquo;s luck held good; no ship made more successful
trips than his own; but whenever he came
to the Lekang Islands he lay becalmed&mdash;the goblins
went aboard or ashore with their goods&mdash;but after
a time he had fair winds, whether he happened to
want to go to Bergen, or sail home. He had many
children, and all of them were bright and vigorous,
yet every one of them lacked the upper joint of the
little finger of his left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky Andrew&rdquo; (Asbjörnsen, <cite lang="no" xml:lang="no">Huldreeventyr</cite>, I, p.&nbsp;286. From
Heligoland) is one of a type which is a favorite character in the
fairy-tale, care-free, brave and always happy, though he dwells in
awful loneliness in the midst of the sea, and comes across the most
sinister goblins.</p>

<h2>XXXI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE PASTOR AND THE SEXTON</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a pastor who was
such a boor that when any one was driving
toward him along the highway, he would shout to
them, while still some distance off: &ldquo;Get out of the
way! Get out of the pastor&rsquo;s way!&rdquo; One day, while
he was doing this, along came the king. &ldquo;Get out of
the way! Get out of the way!&rdquo; shouted the pastor.
But the king drove as he had a mind to, and he
drove so fast that this time it was the pastor who
had to get out of the way, and when the king passed
him, he called out: &ldquo;See that you come to me at the
castle to-morrow, and if you cannot answer three
questions I put to you, then you will have to take
off your pastor&rsquo;s gown as a punishment for your
arrogance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sounded different from what the pastor was
used to hearing. Shout and bluster, and completely
forget himself in his arrogance, that he knew how
to do; but returning a plain answer to a plain question
was not his strong point. So he went to the
sexton, who was supposed to have more in his upper
story than the pastor. He told him he did not venture
to go to the castle, because &ldquo;a fool can ask
more than ten wise men can answer,&rdquo; said he, and
he induced the sexton to go in his stead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The sexton set forth, and came to the castle
dressed in the pastor&rsquo;s gown and ruff. The king
received him out in the entrance with crown and
scepter, and was so splendidly dressed that he fairly
gleamed and shone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, are you here?&rdquo; Yes, indeed, there he was.
&ldquo;First tell me,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;the distance from
East to West.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is one day&rsquo;s journey,&rdquo; said
the sexton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is that?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;Well, the
sun rises in the East and goes down in the West, and
manages to do so nicely in the course of a single
day,&rdquo; said the sexton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;but now tell me how much
I am worth, just as I stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if our Lord Christ himself was valued at
thirty pieces of silver, then I can hardly value you
at more than twenty-nine,&rdquo; said the sexton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well and good,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;but since you
are so wondrous wise, tell me what I am thinking
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my lord king, you are probably thinking that
this is the pastor who is standing before you, but
there you are greatly mistaken, for I am the sexton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then drive straight home, and be the pastor,
and the pastor shall be the sexton,&rdquo; said the king,
and that is what happened, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXXII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE SKIPPER AND SIR URIAN</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a master mariner
who had the most unheard of good fortune in
all that he undertook; none had such splendid cargoes,
and none earned so much money as he did,
for everything seemed to come to him. And it is
quite certain that there were none who could risk
taking the trips he did, for wherever he sailed he
had fair winds, yes, it was even said that when he
turned around his cap, the wind turned with it, to
suit his wish.</p>

<p>Thus he sailed for many years with cargoes of
lumber, and even went as far as China, and earned
money like hay. But once he sailed the North Sea
with all sails set, as though he had stolen ship and
cargo. But the one who was after him sailed even
more swiftly. And that was Sir Urian, the devil!
With him the master mariner, as you may imagine,
had made a bargain, and that very day and hour
the contract expired, and the mariner had to be prepared,
from moment to moment, to see him arrive
to fetch him.</p>

<p>So he came up on deck, out of the cabin, and took
a look at the weather. Then he called the ship&rsquo;s carpenter
and several others, and told them to go down
at once into the ship&rsquo;s hold, and bore two holes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the ship&rsquo;s bottom. Then they were to take the
pumps from out their frames, and set them closely
over the holes, so that the water would rise quite
high in the pipes.</p>

<p>The men were surprised, and thought his orders
passing strange, yet they did as he told them. They
bored the holes, and set up the pumps closely over
them, so that not even a drop of water could get
at the cargo; yet the North Sea stood seven feet
high in the pumps.</p>

<p>No more had they cast overboard their chips and
litter than Sir Urian came along in a squall, and
grabbed the master mariner by the collar. &ldquo;Wait,
old boy, the matter is not so terribly urgent!&rdquo; said
he, and began to defend himself, and pry loose the
claws that held him with an awl. &ldquo;Did you not
bind yourself in your contract always to keep my
ship tight and dry?&rdquo; said the master mariner.
&ldquo;You are a nice article! Just take a look at the
pumps! The water stands seven feet high in the
pipes! Pump, devil, pump my ship dry, then you
may take me to have and to hold as long as ever
you wish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The devil was fool enough, and allowed himself to
be hoaxed. He worked and sweat, and the perspiration
ran down his cheeks in such streams that one
might have run a mill with them, but he merely kept
on pumping out of the North Sea into the North Sea.
At last he had enough of it, and when he could pump
no longer, he flew home to his grandmother to rest.
He let the master mariner stay master mariner as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
long as he might choose, and if he has not died he is
still sailing the seas at his own sweet will, and letting
the wind blow according to how he turns his
cap.</p>

<h2>XXXIII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE YOUTH WHO WAS TO SERVE THREE YEARS
WITHOUT PAY</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a poor man, who
had only one son; but one who was so lazy and
clumsy that he did not want to do a stroke of work.
&ldquo;If I am not to feed this bean-pole for the rest of
my life, I&rsquo;ll have to send him far away, where not
a soul knows him,&rdquo; thought the father. &ldquo;Once he
is knocking about in the world, he will not be so
likely to come home again.&rdquo; So he took his son and
led him about in the world, far and wide, and tried
to get him taken on as a serving man; but no one
would have him. Finally, after wandering a long
time, they came to a rich man, of whom it was said
that he turned every shilling around seven times before
he could make up his mind to part with it. He
was willing to take the youth for a servant, and he
was to work three years without pay. But at the
end of the three years, his master was to go into
town, two days in succession, and buy the first thing
he saw, and on the third morning the youth himself
was to go to town and also buy the first thing he
met. And all this he was to receive in lieu of his
wage.</p>

<p>So the youth served out his three years, and did
better than they had expected him to do. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
by no means a model serving-man; but then his master
was none of the best, either, for he let him go
all that time in the same clothes he had worn when
he entered his service, until, finally, one patch elbowed
the other.</p>

<p>Now when his master was to go to do his buying,
he set out as early as possible in the morning.
&ldquo;Costly wares are only to be seen by day,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;they are not drifting about the street so early. It
will probably cost me enough as it is, for what I find
is a matter of purest chance.&rdquo; The first thing he
saw on the street was an old woman, who was carrying
a covered basket. &ldquo;Good-day, granny,&rdquo; said
the man. &ldquo;And good-day to you, daddy,&rdquo; said the
old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you in your basket?&rdquo; asked the man.
&ldquo;Would you like to know?&rdquo; said the woman.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;for I have to buy the first
thing that comes my way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, if you want to
know, buy it!&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;What does
it cost?&rdquo; asked the man. She must have four shillings
for it, declared the woman. This did not seem
such a tremendous price to him, he would let it go
at that, said he, and raised the cover. And there lay
a pup in the basket. When the man got home from
his journey to town, there stood the youth full of
impatience and curiosity, wondering what his wage
for the first year might be. &ldquo;Are you back already,
master?&rdquo; asked the youth. &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said
his master. &ldquo;And what have you bought?&rdquo; asked
the youth. &ldquo;What I have bought is nothing so very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
rare,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know whether I
ought to show it to you; but I bought the first thing
to be had, and that was a pup,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And I
thank you most kindly for it,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;I
have always been fond of dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following morning it was no better. The man
set out as early as possible, and had not as yet
reached town before he met the old woman with the
basket. &ldquo;Good-day, granny,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;And
good-day to you, daddy,&rdquo; said the old woman.
&ldquo;What have you in your basket to-day?&rdquo; asked the
man. &ldquo;If you want to know, then buy it!&rdquo; was again
the answer. &ldquo;What does it cost?&rdquo; asked the man.
She wanted four shillings for it, she had only the one
price. The man said he would buy it, for he thought
that this time he would make a better purchase. He
raised the cover, and this time a kitten lay in the
basket. When he reached home, there stood the
youth, waiting to see what he was to get in lieu of
his second year&rsquo;s wages. &ldquo;Are you back again,
master!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said the master.
&ldquo;What did you buy to-day?&rdquo; asked the youth.
&ldquo;Alas, nothing better than I did yesterday,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;but I did as we agreed, and bought the
first thing I came across, and that was this kitten.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You could not have hit on anything better,&rdquo; said
the youth, &ldquo;for all my life long I have been fond
of cats as well as of dogs.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not fare so badly
this way,&rdquo; thought the man, &ldquo;but when he sets out
for himself, then the matter will probably turn out
differently.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>So the third morning the youth set out for himself,
and when he entered town, he came across the
same old woman with her basket on her arm. &ldquo;Good
morning, granny,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And good morning to
you, my boy,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;What have
you in your basket?&rdquo; asked the youth. &ldquo;If you want
to know, then buy it!&rdquo; answered the old woman.
&ldquo;Do you want to sell it?&rdquo; asked the youth. Yes,
indeed, and it would cost four shillings, said the old
woman. That is a bargain, thought the youth, and
wanted to take it, for he had to buy the first thing
that came his way. &ldquo;Well, you can take the whole
blessed lot,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;the basket and
all that&rsquo;s in it. But do not look into it before you
get home, do you hear!&rdquo; No, indeed, he would be
sure not to look in the basket, said he. But on the
way, he kept wondering as to what might be in the
basket, and willy-nilly&mdash;he could not keep from raising
the cover a little, and looking through the crack.
But that very minute a little lizard popped out of the
crack, and ran across the road so quickly that it
fairly hummed&mdash;and aside from the lizard there was
nothing in the basket. &ldquo;Stop, wait a minute, and
don&rsquo;t run away! I just bought you,&rdquo; said the youth.
&ldquo;Stab me in the neck! Stab me in the neck!&rdquo; cried
the lizard. The youth did not have to be told twice.
He ran after the lizard and stabbed it in the neck
just as it was slipping into a hole in a wall. And
that very moment it turned into a man, as handsome
and splendid as the handsomest prince, and
a prince he was, if truth be told.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you have delivered me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for the
old woman, with whom you and your master have
been dealing, is a witch, and she turned me into a
lizard, and my brother and sister into a dog and
cat.&rdquo; The youth thought this a remarkable tale.
&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;She was actually
on the way to throw us into the sea and drown us;
but if any one were to appear and want to buy us,
she had to sell us for four shillings apiece, that had
been agreed upon. And now you shall go home with
me to my father, and be rewarded for your good
deed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your home must be a good way off,&rdquo; said
the youth. &ldquo;O, it is not so far,&rdquo; declared the prince,
&ldquo;there it is!&rdquo; And he pointed to a high hill in the
distance.</p>

<p>They marched along as fast as they could, but still
it was farther away than it seemed. So it was late
at night before they reached their goal. The prince
knocked. &ldquo;Who is knocking at my door, and disturbing
my sleep?&rdquo; came a voice within the hill.
And the voice was so powerful that the earth trembled.
&ldquo;Open, father, your son has come home!&rdquo;
cried the prince. Then the father was glad to open
the door quickly. &ldquo;I thought you were already lying
at the bottom of the sea,&rdquo; said the old man.
&ldquo;But you are not alone?&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the chap who
delivered me,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;and I asked him
to come with me so that you could reward him.&rdquo;
That he would attend to, said the old man. &ldquo;Now
you must come right in,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for here you may
rest in safety.&rdquo; They went in and sat down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the old man laid an armful of wood and a couple of
big logs on the fire, until every corner was as bright
as day, and wherever they looked everything was
indescribably splendid. The youth had never seen
anything like it, and such fine things to eat and
drink as the old man served up to him, he had never
yet tasted. And the bowls and dishes, and goblets
and plates, were all of pure silver and shining gold.</p>

<p>There was no need to urge the young folk. They
ate and drank and enjoyed themselves, and then slept
far into the next day. The youth was still asleep
when the old man came and offered him a morning
draft in a golden goblet. And when he had put
on his rags and breakfasted, he was allowed to pick
out what he wanted, as a reward for delivering the
prince. There was much to see and still more to
take, as you may believe. &ldquo;Well, what do you
want?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;You may take what you
will; for as you see there is enough from which to
choose.&rdquo; The youth said he would have to think it
over a bit, and speak to the prince. And that he was
allowed to do. &ldquo;Well, I suppose you have seen all
sorts of beautiful things?&rdquo; asked the prince. &ldquo;That
is a fact,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;But tell me, what ought
I to choose among all these magnificent things?
Your father said I might pick out whatever I
wished.&rdquo; &ldquo;You must choose none among all the
things you have seen,&rdquo; answered the prince, &ldquo;but
my father wears a ring on his little finger, and you
must ask him for that.&rdquo; This the youth did, and
begged the king for the ring on his finger. &ldquo;It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
dearer to me than anything else I have,&rdquo; said the
king, &ldquo;but my son is just as dear to me, and therefore
I will give you the ring. Do you know what
powers it has?&rdquo; No, that the youth did not know.
&ldquo;While you wear it on your finger, you can get
everything that you want to have,&rdquo; said the king.
The youth thanked him most kindly, and the king
and the prince wished him all manner of luck on his
journey, and charged him to take the best care of
the ring.</p>

<p>He had not been long underway before it occurred
to him to test what the ring could do. So he wished
to be dressed in new clothes from head to toe, and
no more had he uttered the wish than there he was
in them. And he looked as handsome and bright as
a new nickel. Then he thought to himself it would
be pleasant to play a trick on his father. &ldquo;He was
none too friendly to me while I was still at home.&rdquo;
And so the youth wished he were standing before
his father&rsquo;s door, just as ragged as he had been before.
And that very minute there he stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, father, and many thanks for the last
time!&rdquo; said the youth. But when his father saw he
had come home far more tattered and torn than when
he had gone away, he grew angry and began to
scold: &ldquo;There is nothing to be made of you, if during
all the long years of your service you have not
even been able to earn a suit of clothes to your
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now do not be so angry, father,&rdquo; said the youth.
&ldquo;You need not take for granted that a fellow is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
vagabond because he goes about in rags. Now I want
you to go to the king as my proxy, and ask his
daughter&rsquo;s hand for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, come, why, that
is utter folly and nonsense!&rdquo; cried his father. But
the youth insisted that it was gospel truth, and took
a birch bough, and drove his father to the king&rsquo;s
castle-gate. And the latter came stumbling right in
to the king, and wept so that the tears just tumbled
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what has happened to you, my dear fellow?&rdquo;
asked the king. &ldquo;If a wrong has been done
you, I will see that you get your rights.&rdquo; No, no
wrong had been done him, said the man, but he had
a son who gave him a great deal of trouble: it was
impossible to make a man of him, and now he had
evidently lost what few senses he did possess. &ldquo;Because
he has just chased me to the castle-gate with
a birch bough, and threatened me, if I do not get
him the king&rsquo;s daughter for a bride,&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;Set your mind at rest, my good fellow,&rdquo; said the
king, &ldquo;and send your son to me. Then we will see
whether we can come to an understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth came rushing in to the king, so that his
rags fairly fluttered. &ldquo;Do I get your daughter?&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Well, that is just what we are going to discuss,&rdquo;
said the king, &ldquo;perhaps she would not answer
for you, and perhaps you would not answer for her,&rdquo;
said he. That might be the case, said the youth.</p>

<p>Now a great ship from abroad had shortly before
come into port, and one could see it from the castle
window. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
can build a ship that is the exact counterpart of the
one outside, and just as handsome, in the space of
an hour or two, then, perhaps, you may get my
daughter,&rdquo; said the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it be no more than that ...&rdquo; said the youth.
Then he went down to the shore and sat on a sand-pile,
and when he had sat there long enough, he
wished that a ship might lie out in the fjord, completely
equipped with masts and sails and all that
goes with them, and that it might resemble the ship
already lying there in every particular. And that
very minute there lay the ship, and when the king
saw that there were two ships at anchor instead of
one, he came down to the shore himself to look more
closely into the matter. And then he saw the youth.
He was standing in a boat, with a broom in one
hand, as though he meant to give the ship a final
cleaning; but when he saw the king coming, he threw
away the broom and cried: &ldquo;Now the ship is finished.
Do I get your daughter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all very fine,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;but you
must stand yet another test. If you can build a
castle that is just like mine in every particular
within an hour or so, then we will go further into
the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than that?&rdquo; cried the youth. After he
had strolled around for a long while, and the time
set was nearly over, he wished that a castle might
stand there that resembled the king&rsquo;s castle in every
particular. And before long there it stood, as you
may believe. And it did not take long, either, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the king, together with the queen and the princess,
came to look at the new castle. The youth
stood there with his broom again, and swept and
cleaned. &ldquo;Now the castle is in apple-pie order. Do
I get her now?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; declared the king, &ldquo;just
come in and we&rsquo;ll talk it over,&rdquo; said he, for he had
noticed that the youth knew a thing or two, and he
was thinking over how he might get rid of him. The
king went on ahead, and after him the queen, and
then went the princess, just in advance of the youth.
Then he at once wished to be the handsomest man
in the world, and so he was, that very minute. When
the princess saw what a splendid figure he suddenly
cut, she nudged the queen, who in turn nudged the
king, and after they had stared at him long enough,
they at last realized that the youth was more
than he had at first appeared to be, in his rags.
So they decided that the princess was to treat him
nicely, in order to find out how matters really stood,
and the princess was as sweet and amiable as sugar-bread,
and flattered the youth, and said that she
could not do without him, night or day. And when
it came toward the end of the first evening, she said:
&ldquo;Since you and I are to be married in any case, I
am sure you will have no secrets from me, and you
will not want to hide from me how you managed to
do all these fine things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;You shall know about
it, but first of all let us be married; before that nothing
counts!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The following evening the princess pretended to
be quite unhappy. She was well aware, said she,
that he did not attach much importance to her love,
when he would not even tell her what she wanted
so much to know. If he could not even oblige her
in such a small matter, his love could not amount
to a great deal. Then the youth fell into despair,
and to make up with her again, he told her everything.
She lost no time, and let the king and queen
know all about it. Thereupon they agreed as to
how they would go about getting the youth&rsquo;s ring
away from him, and then, thought they, it would not
really be hard to get rid of him.</p>

<p>In the evening the princess came with a sleeping
potion, and said she wanted to give her lover a drink
that would increase his love for her, since it was
plain he did not love her enough. The youth suspected
nothing, and drank, and at once fell so fast
asleep that they could have pulled down the house
over his head. Then the princess drew the ring
from his finger, put it on herself, and wished the
youth might be lying on the garbage-pile in the
street, just as tattered and torn as he had come
to them, and in his place she wanted the handsomest
prince in the world. And that very minute everything
happened just as she wished. After a time
the youth woke up, out on the garbage-pile, and at
first thought he was dreaming: but when he saw the
ring was gone, he understood how it all had happened,
and fell into such despair that he got up and
wanted to jump right into the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>But then he met the cat his master had bought
for him. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;To
throw myself into the sea and drown,&rdquo; was the
youth&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not do so on any account,&rdquo; said the cat.
&ldquo;You will get your ring again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if that were so, then ...&rdquo; said the
youth.</p>

<p>The cat ran away. Suddenly a rat crossed her
path. &ldquo;Now I will pounce on you!&rdquo; said the cat.
&ldquo;O do not do that,&rdquo; said the rat, &ldquo;you shall have
the ring again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that is so, then ...&rdquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>When the folk at the castle had gone to bed, the
rat crept around, and sniffed and spied out the
room of the prince and princess; and at last he found
a little hole through which he crawled. Then he
heard the prince and princess talking to each other,
and saw that the prince was wearing the ring on his
finger. Before she went, the princess said: &ldquo;Good
night. And see that you take good care of the ring,
my dearest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! no one will come in through the walls for
the sake of a ring,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;but if you think
it is not safe enough on my hand, why, I can put it
in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time he lay down on his back, and prepared
to go to sleep. But just then the ring slipped
down his throat, and he had to cough, so that the
ring flew out and rolled along the ground. Swish!&mdash;the
rat had caught it, and crept out with it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
cat, who was waiting at the rat-hole. But in the
meantime the king had caught the youth, and had
had him put in a great tower and condemned to
death, because he had made a mock of his daughter&mdash;so
the king said. And the youth was to sit in the
tower until he was beheaded. But the cat kept
prowling around the tower all the time, trying to
sneak in with the ring. And then an eagle came
along, caught her up in his claws and flew across
the sea with her. And suddenly a hawk appeared,
and flung himself on the eagle, and the eagle let the
cat fall into the sea. When she felt the water, she
grew afraid, let the ring fall, and swam to land. No
sooner had she shaken the water from her fur than
she met the dog whom the youth&rsquo;s master had bought
for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what am I to do now?&rdquo; said the cat, and
wept and lamented. &ldquo;The ring is gone, and they
want to murder the youth.&rdquo; &ldquo;That I do not know,&rdquo;
said the dog, &ldquo;but what I do know is that I have
the very worst kind of an ache in my stomach,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you have it. You have surely over-eaten,&rdquo;
said the cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never eat more than I need,&rdquo; said the dog,
&ldquo;and just now I have eaten nothing at all, save a
dead fish that was left here by the ebb-tide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could the fish have swallowed the ring?&rdquo; asked
the cat. &ldquo;And must you, also, lose your life, because
you cannot digest gold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may well be the case,&rdquo; said the dog. &ldquo;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
then it would be best if I died at once, for then the
youth might still be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that is not necessary!&rdquo; said the rat&mdash;who was
there, too&mdash;&ldquo;I do not need a very large opening
through which to crawl, and if the ring is really
there, I am sure I can find it.&rdquo; So the rat slipped
down into the dog, and before very long he came out
again with the ring. And then the cat made her
way to the tower, and clawed her way up till she
found a hole through which she could thrust her
paw, and thus brought back the ring to the youth.</p>

<p>No sooner was it on his finger than he wished
that the tower might break down, and that very
moment he was standing just before the tower-gate,
and reviling the king and the queen and the king&rsquo;s
daughter as though they were the lowest of the low.
The king hastily called together his army, and told
it to surround the tower, and take the youth prisoner,
dead or alive. But the youth only wished the
whole army might be sticking up to their necks in
the big swamp in the hills, and there they had trouble
enough getting out&mdash;those among them who did
not stick fast. Then he went right on reviling
where he had stopped, and finally, when he had told
them all just what he thought of them, he wished
that the king, the queen and the king&rsquo;s daughter
might sit for the rest of their lives in the tower
into which they had thrust him. And when they
were sitting there, he took possession of the king&rsquo;s
land and country on his own account. Then the
dog changed into a prince, and the cat into a princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and he made the latter his wife, and they were
married and celebrated their wedding long and profusely.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Youth Who Was to Serve Three Years Without Pay&rdquo;
(Asbjörnsen, N.F.E., No.&nbsp;63, p.&nbsp;8. From Gudbrandsdal) we have
the tale of a magic ring, whose possessor is robbed of it by a faithless
woman, and which is brought back to him by faithful animals,

<h2>XXXIV<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE YOUTH WHO WANTED TO WIN THE DAUGHTER
OF THE MOTHER IN THE CORNER</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a woman who had a
son, and he was so lazy and slow that there
was not a single blessed useful thing he would do.
But he liked to sing and to dance, and that is what
he did all day long, and far into the night as well.
The longer this went on, the worse off his mother
was. The youth was growing, and he wanted so
much to eat that it was barely possible to find it,
and more and more went for his clothes the older he
grew, since his clothes did not last long, as you may
imagine, because the youth skipped and dance about
without stopping, through forest and field.</p>

<p>At length it was too much for his mother, so one
day she told the young fellow that he ought at last
to get to work, and really do something, or both of
them would have to starve to death. But the youth
had no mind to do so, he said, and would rather try
to win the daughter of the mother in the corner, for
if he got her, then he would live happily ever after,
and could sing and dance, and would not have to
plague himself with work.</p>

<p>When the mother heard that she thought it might
not be such a bad idea after all, and she dressed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the youth as well as she could, so that he would
make a good showing when he came to the mother
in the corner, and then he set forth.</p>

<p>When he stepped out the sun was shining bright
and warm; but it had rained during the night, and
the ground was soft and full of water puddles. The
youth took the shortest path to the mother in the
corner, and sang and danced, as he always did. But
suddenly, as he was hopping and skipping along, he
came to a swamp, and there were only some logs
laid down to cross it; and from the one log he had
to jump over a puddle to a clump of grass, unless he
wanted to dirty his shoes. And then he went kerflop!
The very moment he set foot on the clump
of grass, he went down and down until he was
standing in a dark, ugly hole. At first he could see
nothing at all, but when he had been there a little
while, he saw that there was a rat, who was wiggling
and waggling around, and had a bunch of keys hanging
from her tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come, my boy?&rdquo; said the rat. &ldquo;I must
thank you for coming to visit me: I have been expecting
you for a long time. I am sure you have
come to win me, and I can well imagine that you
are in a great hurry. But you must have a little
patience. I am to receive a large dower, and am
not yet ready for the wedding; but I will do my
best to see that we are married soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she had said this, she produced a couple of
egg-shells, with all sorts of eatables such as rats eat,
and set them down before the youth, and said: &ldquo;Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
you must sit down and help yourself, for I am sure
you are tired and hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth had no great appetite for this food.
&ldquo;If I were only away and up above again,&rdquo; thought
he, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I think you must surely want to get home
again,&rdquo; said the rat. &ldquo;I am well aware that you
are waiting impatiently for the wedding, and I will
hurry all I can. Take this linen thread along, and
when you get up above, you must not turn around,
but must go straight home, and as you go you must
keep repeating: &lsquo;Short before and long behind!&rsquo;&rdquo;
and with that she laid a linen thread in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised!&rdquo; said the youth when he
was up above once more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go down there
again in a hurry.&rdquo; But he held the thread in his
hand, and danced and sang as usual. And although
he no longer had the rat-hole in mind, he began to
hum:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Short before and long behind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short before and long behind!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When he stood before the door at home, he turned
around; and there lay many, many hundred yards of
the finest linen, finer than the most skillful weaver
could have spun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, come out, come out!&rdquo; called and cried
the youth. His mother came darting out, and asked
what was the matter. And when she saw the linen,
stretching as far as she could see, and then a bit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
she could not believe her eyes, until the youth told
her how it all happened. But when she had heard
that, and had tested the linen between her fingers,
she was so pleased that she, too, began to sing and
dance.</p>

<p>Then she took the linen, cut it, and sewed shirts
from it for her son and herself, and the remainder
she took to town and sold for a good price. Then
for a time they lived in all joy and comfort. But
when that was over the woman had not a bite to eat
in the house, and so she told her son that it was the
highest time for him to take service, and really do
something, or else both of them would have to starve
to death.</p>

<p>But the youth preferred to go to the mother in
the corner, and try to win her daughter. His mother
did not think this such a bad idea, for now the youth
was handsomely dressed, and made a good showing.</p>

<p>So she brushed him, and furbished him up as well
as she could, and he himself took a pair of new shoes,
and polished them till they shone like a mirror, and
when he had done so, off he went. Everything happened
as before. When he stepped out, the sun was
shining bright and warm; but it had rained during
the night, and the road was soft and muddy, and
every puddle was full of water. The youth took the
shortest way to the mother in the corner, and sang
and danced and danced and sang, as he always did.
He followed another road, not the one he had taken
before; but as he was hopping and skipping along,
he suddenly came to the log across the swamp, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
from the log he had to jump over a puddle to a clump
of grass, unless he wanted to dirty his shoes. And
then he went kerflop. And he sank down and could
not stop, until he reached a horrible, dark, ugly hole.
At first he could see nothing; but after he had
stood there a while, he discovered a rat with a bunch
of keys at the end of her tail, which she was wiggling
and waggling in front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come, my boy?&rdquo; said the rat. &ldquo;You
are welcome among us! It was kind of you to come
and visit me again so soon; no doubt you are very
impatient, I can well imagine it. But you must
really be patient a little while longer; for my trousseau
is not quite complete, but by the time you come
again all shall be ready.&rdquo; When she had said this
she offered him egg-shells containing all sorts of
food such as rats like. But it looked to the youth
like food that had been eaten, and he said that he
had no appetite. &ldquo;If I were only safely away, and
up above again,&rdquo; thought he, but he said nothing.
After a time the rat said: &ldquo;Now I think you must
surely want to get up above again. I will hurry on
the wedding as quickly as I can. And now take this
woolen thread along, and when you get up above,
you must not turn around, but go straight home, and
underway you must keep on repeating: &lsquo;Short before
and long behind!&rsquo;&rdquo; and with that she laid the
woolen thread in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven, I have escaped!&rdquo; said the youth
to himself. &ldquo;I am sure I&rsquo;ll never go there again,&rdquo;
and then he sang and danced again as usual. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
thought no more of the rat-hole, but fell to humming,
and sang without stopping:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Short before and long behind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short before and long behind!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When he stood at the door of the house, he happened
to look around; and there lay the finest
woolen goods, many hundred yards of it, stretching
for half a mile, and so fine that no city counselor
wore a coat of finer cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, mother, come out, come out!&rdquo; cried the
youth. His mother came to the door, clasped her
hands together over her head, and nearly fainted
with joy when she saw all the fine goods. And then
the youth had to tell her how it had come to him,
and all that had taken place, from beginning to end.
This brought them a small fortune, as you may
imagine. The youth had new clothes, and his
mother went to town and sold the goods, yard by
yard, and was handsomely paid for them. And then
she decorated her room, and she herself, in her old
days, went about in such style that she might have
been taken for some lady of distinction. So they
lived splendidly and happily, but finally this money,
too, came to an end; and one day the woman had not
a bite to eat left in the house, and told her son that
now he had better look for work, and really do something,
or both of them would starve to death.</p>

<p>But the youth thought it would be much better
to go to the mother in the corner and try to win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
her daughter. This time his mother again agreed
with him, and did not contradict the youth; for now
he had fine new clothes, and looked so distinguished
that it seemed out of the question to her that such
a good-looking fellow would be refused. So she furbished
him up and tricked him out in the handsomest
way, and he himself took out his new shoes and polished
them so brightly that you could see yourself in
them, and when he had done so he set forth.</p>

<p>This time he did not choose the shortest road; but
took a roundabout way, the longest he could find, for
he did not want to go down to the rat again because
he was sick of her eternal wiggling and waggling,
and the talk about marriage. The weather
and the road were exactly the same as when he had
gone before. The sun shone, the swamp and the
puddles gleamed, and the youth sang and danced as
usual. And in the midst of his skipping and jumping,
before he knew it, there he stood at the same
crossing which led across the swamp. There he had
to jump over a puddle to a clump of grass, unless he
wanted to dirty his brightly polished shoes. &ldquo;Kerflop!&rdquo;
and down he went, and did not stop until he
stood once more in the same dark, ugly, dirty hole.
At first he was pleased because he could see nothing.
But after he had stood there a while, he once more
discovered the ugly rat who was so repulsive to him,
with the bunch of keys hanging from her tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, my boy,&rdquo; said the rat. &ldquo;You are welcome!
I see that you can no longer live without
me, and I thank you. And now everything is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
readiness for our wedding, and we will go straight
to church.&rdquo; Nothing will come of that, thought the
youth, but he did not say a word. Then the rat
whistled, and at once every corner was alive with
swarms of mice and small rats, and six large rats
came dragging along a frying-pan. Two mice sat
up behind as grooms, and two sprang up in front to
drive the coach. Several seated themselves within,
and the rat with the bunch of keys took her place in
their midst. To the youth she said: &ldquo;The road is a
little narrow here, so you will have to walk beside
the coach, sweetheart, until the road is broader.
And then you may sit beside me in the coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fine that will be!&rdquo; thought the youth. &ldquo;If
I were only safely up above once more, I would run
away from the whole pack of them,&rdquo; thought he,
but he said nothing. He went along with the procession
as well as he could; at times he had to crawl,
at others he had to stoop, for the way was very
narrow. But when it grew better, he walked in advance,
and looked about to see how he might most
easily steal away and make off. And then he suddenly
heard a clear, beautiful voice behind him say:
&ldquo;Now the road is good! Come, sweetheart, and get
into the coach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth turned around quickly, and was so astonished
that his nose and ears nearly fell off.
There stood a magnificent coach with six white
horses, and in the coach sat a maiden as fair and
beautiful as the sun, and about her were sitting
others, as bright and kindly as the stars. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
a princess and her playmates, who had all been enchanted
together. But now they were delivered, because
he had come down to them, and had never
contradicted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along now!&rdquo; said the princess. Then the
youth got into the coach, and drove to church with
her. And when they drove away from the church,
the princess said: &ldquo;Now we will first drive to my
home, and then we will send for your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; thought the youth&mdash;he said
nothing, but he thought it would be better, after all,
to drive to his home, instead of down into the hideous
rat-hole. But suddenly they came to a beautiful
castle, and there they turned in, for there it was they
were to live. And at once a fine coach with six
horses was sent for the youth&rsquo;s mother, and when
she came the wedding festivities began. They celebrated
for fourteen days, and perhaps they are celebrating
yet. We must hurry, and perhaps we may
still get there in time, and can drink the groom&rsquo;s
health and dance with the bride!</p>

<span class="f8">THE CHRONICLE OF THE PANCAKE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a woman who had
seven hungry children, and she was baking
pancakes for them. There was dough made with
new milk, and it lay in the pan, and was rising so
plumply and comfortably, that it was a pleasure to
watch it. The children stood around it, and their
grandfather sat and looked on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a little bit of pancake, mother, I&rsquo;m so
hungry!&rdquo; said one of the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear mother!&rdquo; said the second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, sweet mother!&rdquo; said the third.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, sweet, good mother!&rdquo; said the fourth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, best, sweet, good mother!&rdquo; said the fifth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, best, sweet, good, dearest mother!&rdquo; said
the sixth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, best, sweet, good, dearest, sweetest
mother!&rdquo; said the seventh, and so they all begged
around the pancake, one more sweetly than the other,
for they were all so hungry and so well-behaved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, children, wait until it turns around,&rdquo; said
she&mdash;until I have turned it around, she should have
said&mdash;&ldquo;then you shall all have a pancake, a lovely
best-milk pancake. Just see how fat and comfortable
it is lying there!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>When the pancake heard that it was frightened,
turned itself around suddenly, and wanted to get out
of the pan; but it only fell on its other side, and
when this had baked a little, so that it took shape
and grew firmer, it leaped out on the floor, and
rolled off like a wheel, out of the door, and down the
street.</p>

<p>Hey there! The woman was after it with the pan
in one hand, and the spoon in the other, as fast as
she could, and after her came the children, and last
of all, their grandfather came hobbling along.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Will you wait! Halt! Catch it! Hold it!&rdquo; they
all cried together, and wanted to catch up with it
and grab it on the run; but the pancake rolled and
rolled, and sure enough, it got so far ahead of them
that they could no longer see it, for it had nimbler
legs than all of them. After it had rolled a while
it met a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Man Tan,&rdquo; said the pancake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, good pancake, don&rsquo;t roll so fast; but wait
a little and let me eat you!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Gray and grandpa I&rsquo;ve left behind, and
the seven squallers, too, you&rsquo;ll find, so I think I can
leave you as well, Man Tan!&rdquo; said the pancake, and
rolled and rolled until it met a hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Hen Glen,&rdquo; said the pancake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, good pancake, don&rsquo;t roll so fast, wait a
little and I will eat you up!&rdquo; said the hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Gray and grandpa I&rsquo;ve left behind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the seven squallers, too, you&rsquo;ll find, and Man Tan, so
I think I can leave you as well, Hen Glen!&rdquo; said
the pancake, and rolled along the road like a wheel.
Then it met a rooster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the rooster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Rooster Booster,&rdquo; said the pancake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, good pancake, don&rsquo;t roll so fast. Wait
a little and I will eat you up!&rdquo; said the rooster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Gray and grandpa I&rsquo;ve left behind, and
the seven squallers, too, you&rsquo;ll find, and Man Tan
and Hen Glen, and so I think I can leave you as
well, Rooster Booster,&rdquo; said the pancake, and rolled
and rolled as fast as ever it could. And after it had
rolled a long time it met a duck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the duck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Duck Tuck,&rdquo; said the pancake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, good pancake, don&rsquo;t roll so fast. Wait a
little and I will eat you up!&rdquo; said the duck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Gray and grandpa I&rsquo;ve left behind, and
the seven squallers, too, you&rsquo;ll find, and Man Tan,
and Hen Glen and Rooster Booster, so I think I can
leave you as well,&rdquo; said the pancake, and rolled on
as fast as ever it could. After it had rolled a long,
long time, it met a goose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the goose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Goose Loose,&rdquo; said the pancake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, good pancake, don&rsquo;t roll so fast. Wait a
little and I will eat you up!&rdquo; said the goose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Gray and grandpa I&rsquo;ve left behind, and
the seven squallers, too, you&rsquo;ll find, and Man Tan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and Hen Glen and Rooster Booster and Duck Tuck,
and I think I can leave you as well, Goose Loose,&rdquo;
said the pancake, and rolled away.</p>

<p>After it had again rolled for a long, long time, it
met a gander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the gander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Gander Meander,&rdquo; said the pancake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, good pancake, don&rsquo;t roll so fast. Wait a
little and I will eat you up!&rdquo; said the gander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother Gray and grandpa I&rsquo;ve left behind, and
the seven squallers, too, you&rsquo;ll find, and Man Tan
and Hen Glen and Rooster Booster and Duck Tuck
and Goose Loose, and I think I can leave you as
well, Gander Meander,&rdquo; said the pancake, and began
to roll as fast as ever it could.</p>

<p>After it had rolled a long, long time, it met a
pig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, pancake,&rdquo; said the pig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Pig Snig,&rdquo; said the pancake, and began
to roll as fast as ever it could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now wait a little,&rdquo; said the pig. &ldquo;You need not
hurry so, for we can keep each other company going
through the forest and take our time, for it is said
to be haunted.&rdquo; The pancake thought that such was
quite apt to be the case, and so they started off;
but after they had gone a while they came to a
brook.</p>

<p>The pig swam across on his own bacon, which was
easy enough; but the pancake could not get across.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down on my snout,&rdquo; said the pig, &ldquo;and I will
carry you over that way.&rdquo; The pancake did so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Uff, uff!&rdquo; said the pig, and swallowed the pancake
in one mouthful.</p>

<h2>XXXVI<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">SORIA-MORIA CASTLE</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a couple who had an
only son named Halvor. While he was still
but a little lad, he would do nothing at all; but
was always sitting at the hearth, digging in the
ashes. His parents apprenticed him here and apprenticed
him there, to be taught something, but
Halvor never stayed. When he had been anywhere
for a few days, he ran away again, went back home,
sat down at the hearth, and dug in the ashes. But
once a master mariner came along and asked whether
Halvor would not like to go with him, and sail the
seas, and see foreign lands. Indeed, Halvor would
like to do so very much, and it did not take him long
to make up his mind.</p>

<p>How long they sailed the seas I do not know, but
suddenly a powerful storm arose, and when it had
passed, and all had grown quiet once more, they did
not know where they were. They had been driven off
their course to a foreign shore, which none among
them recognized.</p>

<p>And then, since not a breeze was stirring, they lay
there, and Halvor begged the master mariner for
permission to go ashore, and look around, for he
would rather do that than lie down and sleep. &ldquo;Do
you think you are fit to appear before people?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the master mariner. &ldquo;The only clothes you have are
the rags in which you stand and walk!&rdquo; Yet Halvor
insisted, and finally he was given permission. But
he was to come back when the wind blew up. Halvor
went, and it was a fair land. No matter where he
came, there were great plains, with fields and pastures;
but he saw no people at all. The wind blew
up again, but Halvor decided that he had not yet
seen enough, and wanted to go a little further, and
see whether there were no people to be found at all.
After a time he came to a great highway, which was
so even one could have rolled an egg along it with
ease. Halvor went on along this highway, and as
evening drew near, he saw a great castle in the
distance, that shone afar. Since he had been wandering
all day long, without much in the way of
food, he had a fine appetite; but the nearer he came
to the castle, the more frightened he grew.</p>

<p>In the castle there was a fire on the hearth, and
Halvor went into the kitchen, which was beautiful.
The kitchenware was all of silver and gold; but there
were no human beings to be seen. After Halvor had
waited a while, and no one came out, he went and
opened a door. There he saw a princess sitting and
spinning. &ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Has a Christian
soul really come here! But it would be best for
you to go again, if you do not want the troll to swallow
you; for a troll with three heads lives here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And though he had four, I should like to see
him,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;And I am not going away,
for I have done no wrong. But you must give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
something to eat, for I am terribly hungry.&rdquo; When
Halvor had eaten his fill, the princess told him to try
and see whether he could swing the sword that hung
on the wall. But he could not swing it, nor even
raise it. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;you must take
a swallow from the bottle that hangs beside it, for
that is what the troll does when he wants to use the
sword.&rdquo; Halvor took the swallow, and then could
swing the sword at once as though it were nothing at
all. Now, thought he, the troll could just come along
any time. And sure enough, he did come along,
roaring. Halvor placed himself behind the door.
&ldquo;Hu! it smells like Christian blood here!&rdquo; said
the troll, and poked his head in through the door.
&ldquo;Yes, you shall find out it is here and at once,&rdquo; cried
Halvor, and hewed off all his heads. The princess
was filled with joy at her deliverance, and danced
and sang. But then she happened to think of her
sisters, and said: &ldquo;If only my sisters could also be
delivered!&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; asked Halvor. So
she told him that one of them had been carried off
by a troll to a castle six miles further away, and
the other to a castle that lay nine miles away from
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must first help me get
this body out.&rdquo; Halvor was very strong, so he
quickly cleared everything out, cleaned up, and put
all in order. Then they ate, and the following morning
he started off at dawn. He did not rest for a
moment, but wandered all day long. When he spied
the castle, he once more felt a little afraid; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
even handsomer than the other one; but here, too,
there was not a human being to be seen. Then Halvor
went into the kitchen, yet did not stop at all, but
stepped right into the next room. &ldquo;No, it cannot be
possible that a Christian should venture here!&rdquo; cried
the princess. &ldquo;I do not know how long I have been
here; but during all that time I have not seen a single
Christian soul. It would probably be best if you went
away quickly; for a troll with six heads lives here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, I am not going,&rdquo; said Halvor, &ldquo;not even if
he had six heads more.&rdquo; &ldquo;He will seize you and
swallow you alive!&rdquo; said the princess. But that
made no difference, Halvor would not go, and he did
not fear the troll. But he would have to eat and
drink, for he was hungry and thirsty after his long
tramp. He had as much as he wanted; and then the
princess wanted to send him away again. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
cried Halvor, &ldquo;I am not going. I have done no
wrong, and need not fear any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will not worry the troll,&rdquo; said the princess.
&ldquo;He will seize you without any questions
asked. Yet, if you positively will not go, why, try
and see whether you can swing the sword that the
troll uses in war.&rdquo; He could not swing it; but then
the princess told him to take a swallow from the
bottle that hung beside it, and when he had done so
he could swing the sword. Suddenly the troll came,
and he was so large and so fat that he had to move
sideways in order to get through the door. When
he had thrust in his first head, he cried: &ldquo;Huhu! I
smell the blood of a Christian!&rdquo; And that very moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Halvor hewed off his first head, and then all
the rest. The princess was pleased beyond measure;
but then she happened to think of her sisters,
and she wished that they also might be delivered.
Halvor thought this might be done, and wanted to
start out at once. But first he had to help the princess
get the dead troll out of the way and then, the
following morning, he set out. It was a long way to
the castle, and he hurried and ran in order to get
there in good time. Toward evening he spied the
castle, and it was much handsomer than both the
others. This time he felt hardly any fear at all; but
went through the kitchen and right on in. There
sat a princess who was extraordinarily beautiful.
Like the others, she said that no Christian soul had
ever come to the castle since she had been there, and
told him to go away again, as otherwise the troll
would swallow him alive, for he had nine heads.
&ldquo;And though he had nine more, and nine on top of
those, I will not go,&rdquo; said Halvor, and stood by the
stove. The princess earnestly begged him to go, so
that the troll would not devour him, but Halvor said:
&ldquo;Let him come whenever he wishes!&rdquo; Then she
gave him the troll sword, and told him to take a
swallow from the bottle, so that he could swing it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the troll came roaring along. He was
even larger and more powerful than both the others,
and he also had to squeeze himself in at the door
sideways. &ldquo;Hu! I smell the blood of a Christian!&rdquo;
That very moment Halvor hewed off his first head,
and then all of the others; but the last clung to life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
most toughly, and it cost Halvor a good deal of
trouble to cut it off, though he found himself so very
strong.</p>

<p>Now all the princesses met at the castle, and were
happy as they never had been before, in all their
lives, and they fell in love with Halvor and he with
them, and he was to choose the one whom he loved
best; but it was the youngest who loved him the
most of all. Yet Halvor acted strangely, and grew
quite silent and uncommunicative; so the princess
asked him what he was longing for, and whether he
did not enjoy being with them. Yes, he enjoyed it
very much, for they had enough to live on, and he
was well enough off, but yet he was homesick, for his
parents were still living, and he would like to see
them again. That could easily be arranged, said the
princess. &ldquo;You shall go and return without harm,
if you will follow our advice.&rdquo; Indeed, and he would
surely do nothing against their wishes, said Halvor.
Then they dressed him up until he looked as handsome
as a king&rsquo;s son, and put a ring on his finger
that made it possible for the one wearing it to wish
himself away, and back again. But he must not
throw the ring away, and he must not mention their
names, said the princesses, otherwise its power
would be gone, all their joy would come to an end,
and he would never see them again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I might be back at the house at home!&rdquo;
said Halvor, and his wish was at once realized, and
he was standing in front of his parents&rsquo; house before
he knew it. It was dusk, and when the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
folk saw such a handsome, well-dressed stranger
coming, it embarrassed them so that it seemed as
though their bowing and scraping would never end.
Halvor now asked them whether they could not give
him a night&rsquo;s lodging. &ldquo;No, they really could not
do so, for they were quite unprepared for it,&rdquo; said
they, &ldquo;and we are lacking one thing, and another,
which such a distinguished gentleman would wish to
have. It would be best if the gentleman went up to
the castle, whose chimney he can see from here,
where the folk are well prepared.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
Halvor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go there until to-morrow morning.
And now let me stay here overnight. I will be content
to sit by the hearth.&rdquo; The old folk could make
no objection to this, and so Halvor sat down by the
hearth, and began to dig in the ashes, as he used
to when he was the lazybones at home. Then they
chatted about all sorts of matters, and told Halvor
about one thing and another, and finally he asked
them whether they had no children. Yes, they had
a son; but did not know whither he had wandered,
or even whether he were still alive, or already dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I not be this Halvor?&rdquo; said Halvor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am quite sure you could not,&rdquo; said the
woman, starting up. &ldquo;Halvor was so slow and lazy,
and never wanted to do anything, and beside, he
was so tattered that one rag got in the way of the
other. He could never have turned into so fine a
looking gentleman as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time the woman had to go to the hearth,
and rake the fire, and as the firelight fell on Halvor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
just as it used to when he dug in the ashes, she
recognized him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, can it really be you, Halvor?&rdquo; she cried, and
then the two old folk were happy beyond all power
of words, and Halvor had to tell all that had happened
to him, while his mother was so pleased with
him, that she wanted to take him up to the castle
at once, and show him to the girls who had always
been so proud, and had turned up their noses at her
son. So she went first and Halvor followed. When
they came up, she told how Halvor had come back,
and that they ought to see how fine he looked, just
like a prince, said she. &ldquo;We can imagine that,&rdquo;
said the girls, and tossed their heads. &ldquo;He is probably
the same ragged fellow that he used to be.&rdquo; At
that moment Halvor stepped in, and then the girls
were so embarrassed that they ran out of the house
without their caps. And when they came in again,
they were so ashamed that they did not venture to
look at Halvor, whom they had always treated with
such scorn and contempt. &ldquo;Well, you always acted
as though you were so fine and handsome that no
one on earth could compare with you. But you
ought to see the oldest princess, whom I delivered,&rdquo;
said Halvor. &ldquo;Compared to her you look like dairy-maids,
and the middle princess is still handsomer;
while the youngest princess, who is my sweetheart,
is more beautiful than the sun and moon. Would to
God she were here, so that you might see her!&rdquo; said
Halvor.</p>

<p>No sooner had he finished speaking than there they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
stood; but then he was very much upset, for now he
remembered what they had told him.</p>

<p>At the castle they gave a great feast in honor of
the princesses, and made a great deal of them.
But they would not stay. &ldquo;We want to go to your
parents,&rdquo; they said to Halvor, &ldquo;and then we want
to go out and look around.&rdquo; He went with them, and
they came to a big sheet of water beyond the court-yard.
Close beside it was a fair green hill, and there
the princesses decided to sit and rest a while, &ldquo;for it
was so pleasant to look out over the water,&rdquo; said
they. They sat down, and after they had rested a
while, the youngest princess said: &ldquo;Let me stroke
your hair a little, Halvor!&rdquo; Halvor laid his head
in her lap, and she stroked his hair, and before
very long Halvor fell asleep. Then she drew the
ring from his finger, and gave him another in place
of it, and said: &ldquo;All hold on to me&mdash;I wish we were
in Soria-Moria Castle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Halvor woke up he saw very well that he
had lost the princesses, and began to weep and wail,
and was so beside himself with despair that no one
could comfort him. And no matter how hard his
parents begged him, he would not stay at home, but
bade them farewell, and said that he would probably
never see them again, for if he did not find his princesses,
then it would not be worth his while to go on
living.</p>

<p>He still had three hundred dollars, and these he
put in his pocket and started out. After he had gone
a while he met a man with a nice-looking horse. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
decided to buy it, and began to talk with the man.
&ldquo;It is true I did not intend to sell the horse,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;but perhaps we can come to an understanding.&rdquo;
Halvor asked him what he wanted for
it. &ldquo;I did not pay much for it, nor is it worth very
much: it is a good saddle horse, but as a draft horse
it does not amount to much. Yet it could carry you
and your knapsack without difficulty, if you were to
walk a bit from time to time,&rdquo; said the man. At last
they agreed on the price, and Halvor slung his knapsack
across the horse, and from time to time he
walked, and then he rode again. Toward evening he
came to a green hill on which stood a large tree, beneath
which he seated himself. He turned the horse
loose, yet did not lie down to sleep, but took out his
knapsack instead. When day came he wandered on
again, for it seemed to him as though there were no
place in which he could rest. He walked and rode
all day long through a great forest, in which were
many green clearings, that shimmered cheerfully
among the trees. He did not know where he was,
nor did he know whither he was going; but he allowed
himself no more time to rest than his horse
needed to feed in one of the green clearings, and
himself to eat from his knapsack. He walked and
rode, on and on, and thought the forest would never
end.</p>

<p>But on the evening of the following day he saw
something gleaming among the trees. &ldquo;If the people
there are still up, I could warm myself a little, and
get something to eat!&rdquo; thought Halvor. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
got there it was a wretched little hut, and through
the window he saw an old couple sitting in it, as
ancient and gray-headed as doves, and the woman
had so long a nose that she used it at the hearth
for a poker. &ldquo;Good evening! Good evening!&rdquo; said
the old woman. &ldquo;But what are you doing here? No
Christian soul has come this way for the past hundred
years.&rdquo; Halvor told her he was looking for
Soria-Moria Castle, and asked whether she knew
the way to it. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the woman&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;I
do not know, but here comes the moon, I will ask
him. He ought to know, for he shines on everything.&rdquo;
And then, when the moon rose bright and
clear above the tree-tops, the woman went out.
&ldquo;You moon, you moon,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;can you tell me
the way to Soria-Moria Castle?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the
moon, &ldquo;I cannot do that, because when I was shining
there, a cloud lay in my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait a little while,&rdquo; said the old woman to
Halvor. &ldquo;The West Wind will be right along, and
he is sure to know, for he sweeps and blows about
in every corner. Well, I declare, you have a horse,
too!&rdquo; said the old woman when she came in again.
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t let the poor beast stand by the door
there and starve to death; but take it out to the pasture
instead. Or would you like to change with me?
We have a pair of old boots, that carry you twelve
miles further with every step. I will give them to
you in exchange for the horse, and then you will
reach Soria-Moria Castle more quickly.&rdquo; Halvor at
once agreed, and the old woman was so pleased with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the horse, that she almost started dancing then and
there. &ldquo;For now I can ride to church, too,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>Halvor was very restless, and wanted to go right
on again, but the woman said there was no need to
hurry. &ldquo;Lie down on the bench by the stove, and
take a nap, for we have no bed for you,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I will watch for the West Wind&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of a sudden the West Wind came rushing along
so that the walls creaked. The woman ran out: &ldquo;You
West Wind! You West Wind! Can you tell me the
way to Soria-Moria Castle? There is a fellow here
who wants to know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said the West
Wind, &ldquo;I have to go to that very place, and dry the
wash for the wedding soon to be held. If he is quick
afoot, he may come along with me.&rdquo; Halvor ran
out. &ldquo;You must hurry if you are going with me,&rdquo;
said the West Wind; and at once he was up and off
over hill and dale, land and sea, so that Halvor
could hardly keep up with him. &ldquo;Now I have no
more time to keep you company,&rdquo; said the West
Wind, &ldquo;because I have first to tear down a stretch
of pine forest, before I come to the bleaching-field
and dry the wash. But if you keep going along the
hills, you will meet some girls standing there and
washing, and then you will not be far from Soria-Moria
Castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time Halvor came to the girls who were
washing, and they asked him whether he had seen
anything of the West Wind, who was to come and
dry the clothes for the wedding. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Halvor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
&ldquo;He is only tearing down a stretch of pine
forest, and will soon be here,&rdquo; and then he asked the
way to Soria-Moria Castle. They showed it to him,
and when he reached the castle it was fairly alive
with men and horses. But Halvor was so tattered
and torn because he had followed the West Wind
over stick and stone, and through thick and thin, that
he kept to one side, and could not come forward until
the last day of the feast. Then all the folk, as was
the custom, had to drink the health of the bride and
groom, and the cupbearer had to pledge all of them
in turn, knights and serving-men. So at length they
came to Halvor. Halvor drank the health, and then
let the ring which the princess had put on his finger
when he lay by the water fall into the glass, and told
the cupbearer to greet the bride, and bring her the
ring. And the princess at once rose from the table.
&ldquo;Who do you think has first claim to the hand of
one of us,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;the man who delivered us,
or the one who now sits here in the bridegroom&rsquo;s
place?&rdquo; There was only one opinion as to that, and
when Halvor heard it, he did not delay, but cast off
his rags and dressed himself as a bridegroom.
&ldquo;Yes, he is the right one!&rdquo; cried the youngest princess
when she caught sight of him, and she drove the
other one away, and celebrated her wedding with
Halvor.</p>

<h2>XXXVII<br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE PLAYER ON THE JEW&rsquo;S-HARP</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Some</span> two or three generations ago, a three-year-old
ox, belonging to some people who lived in
an alpine meadow in Westfjall, disappeared. And
look for him as they would, they could not find him,
and in the fall they moved down into the valley
again. But while the grandmother was skimming
the cream from the milk-pans in the lean-to the day
before their departure, and the oldest maid in the
hut was scooping the cheese out of the big kettle,
a little shepherd girl came running up, and called
out that the big ox was standing at the salt-lick, and
licking the salt. When the mother stepped out for a
moment, she saw nothing that looked at all like an
ox. So she thought the little girl had probably been
mistaken; but the little one insisted that the big ox
had been there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the white spot he had on his forehead, and
he had broken off one of his horns,&rdquo; said she. The
man himself and his two sons were each out searching
in a different direction, and they searched and
searched; but all three came back at evening, and
none of them had found anything. When they heard
the little girl&rsquo;s story, one of the sons flung himself
on his horse, and rode home at full gallop, in order
to fetch his gun; loaded it with small splinters from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a steel arrow, hurried back posthaste, and shot it
off cross-wise over the salt-lick. &ldquo;If the ox is bewitched,
he ought to appear now,&rdquo; said he. But it
was of no use, the ox was gone and he stayed gone.</p>

<p>The oldest son was to go up on the hill once more,
and take a good look all around. And he searched
in every direction, far and near, until he thought he
could smell the ox; yet in spite of this, he could see
no sign of a living being anywhere, all day long.
Finally he grew angry, and swore that for his part,
the bewitched beast might go to the end of the world;
if he did not want to join the rest of the herd, he
could please himself. With that he turned around,
and went to the herdsman&rsquo;s hut as fast as he could,
meaning to take home with him the bear he had shot.</p>

<p>And there, at the fence of the herdsman&rsquo;s hut,
stood the great ox licking salt. And one of his
horns had been broken off. Where he had been
knocking about so long he himself probably knew,
the young fellow did not.</p>

<p>But now day was so nearly over that he could
just about reach home if he went as he was, and
hurried as fast as he could. But if he had to lead
and pull along the ox besides, it would have been
pitch-dark before he had fairly started. And let me
tell you, the fall nights are really dark, and cold besides,
and it is not wise to camp under the open sky
in the mountains. For this reason he decided to wait
until morning, though a night at the herdsman&rsquo;s hut
would be bleak and lonely. So he chopped a good
armful of birch-boughs, laid them on the hearth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
soon the hut grew warm and comfortable, and as
bright as a room lit with Christmas candles. When
he had eaten his supper, he threw himself down on
the bed of planks, pulled his jew&rsquo;s-harp out of his
waistcoat pocket, and began to play the &ldquo;Bells of
St. Thomas&rdquo; round. But he had not been playing
long before he fell asleep, with the instrument in
his mouth. Suddenly he woke again, and it seemed
to him that he could hear something rustling softly
at the other end of the hut. He turned his head
slightly, and saw a beautiful young girl standing by
the table, braiding her hair. It was so long that
it fell down over her hips, and as lovely and shiny
as though it had been gilded. At first the young fellow
could not see her face, but once, when she happened
to turn in his direction, it seemed to him that
she was the fairest and finest-looking maiden he had
ever laid eyes on. Her like could not have been
found far or near, and he knew every girl in the
parish, well-to-do or otherwise. The young fellow
did not dare address her, for she thought herself
alone, and looked so dear and trustful that he
dreaded frightening her away. So he lay there as
still as a mouse, and did not venture to move so
much as a foot.</p>

<p>Suddenly in came another girl; but she appeared
to be coarser, and had a large mouth and dark complexion,
not as clear and fresh as that of the first
girl; and she did not please him as well. Both were
dressed alike, in green jackets and bodices of red
satin, blue stockings, and with bright silver buckles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
on their shoes. The younger maiden had white
sleeves, that were so fresh and clean they fairly
shone. Her bodice was cut low, and showed a handsome
round clasp, which tinkled delicately whenever
the maiden made the slightest move. And now the
young fellow realized what sort of maidens these
were, and could not get over his astonishment that
there were such beautiful women among the underground
folk. It was Saturday evening, and this was
probably the reason they were dressing and adorning
themselves so busily: no doubt they were expecting
company or suitors. The young fellow could not
make out what they said to each other, for they
whispered so softly that he only caught a word now
and then. Once they spoke of a little white lamb
that had gone lame that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the fault of that young fellow who has
been rushing around in all the empty huts among
the hills, looking for his fire-red ox. I saw him
throw a stone at the little lamb,&rdquo; said the older
girl, the one with the large mouth and dark skin.
&ldquo;He really should be punished for that!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he never knew it was a lamb,&rdquo; replied
the younger one, the beauty with the red cheeks.
&ldquo;And it was not right of grandmother to hide his ox,
and make him hunt for it far and near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have taken his ox, for it was standing
just beside the hut, and he ran right past it,&rdquo; said
the other girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you know he took it to be a rat,&rdquo; the
younger one answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, how stupid those people are,&rdquo; said the older
one again, and laughed until she shook. &ldquo;They pretend
to be wiser than wise, and cannot even tell a
fire-red ox from a rat! Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; and she
laughed so heartily that her sister was also carried
away, and the young fellow himself could not help
but smile a bit.</p>

<p>After a time he began to play a boisterous dance-tune.
And what a fright it gave the girls! They
screamed, ran off helter-skelter in their terror, and
were gone in a flash. But the young fellow kept
on playing. After a little while one of them thrust
in her head at the door, and when they saw what had
frightened them so, they began to whisper and giggle
outside, in front of the hut. And after a time they
ventured in again, and began to dance to the music.
And those girls could really swing around and use
their legs. They almost flew over the uneven floor,
and were so sure of the time that every step they
took was in place.</p>

<p>When they had danced a while, and the young
fellow had made their acquaintance&mdash;or thought that
he had&mdash;he unclasped his belt, and passing it around
the handsomer of the two, drew her to him. And
she allowed him to do so. This angered the young
fellow, for he would not have believed that so dainty
and lovely a girl would have allowed him to act so
familiarly on such short acquaintance. And as
though by chance, he let go one end of his belt and
swish!&mdash;off she was. Her sister ran after her, and
slammed the door behind her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the young fellow was angry with himself because
he had been angry with her. But he thought
he was probably not worthy of obtaining the hand
of so fair and loveable a maiden, for there is an old
saw to the effect that none may escape their fate.
Finally he thought that perhaps he could coax her
back again with his music, and he played one tune
after another, the most beautiful ones he knew.
But the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">huldra</i> maidens did not appear again. At
last his hands and mouth grew so tired that he had
to stop. And then he happened to think of &ldquo;The
Blue Melody,&rdquo; which a minstrel from his part of the
country had learned in ancient times from the underground
folk. No sooner had he commenced it than
both girls came sweeping in once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You play beautifully, you do!&rdquo; said the younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One has to play beautifully when one has such
beautiful listeners,&rdquo; returned the young fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what the cat said when she caught a
mouse,&rdquo; laughed the maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, and I will teach you &lsquo;The Blue Melody&rsquo;!&rdquo;
said he. So they came to him, and watched
while he played. After a time the younger one
put her hand in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is that, is it liquorice?&rdquo; she asked, as
she pulled out a roll of tobacco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, try it!&rdquo; the young fellow answered. She
bit off a little piece, but spat it right out on the
floor again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is liquorice that bites,&rdquo; said she, and she
wiped her tongue on her sleeve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it really so biting?&rdquo; asked the other one, and
also wanted to try it. So the young fellow gave her
some as well, and she had the same experience. They
never wanted to taste such liquorice again in their
lives, so they assured him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can tell you how to get good liquorice,&rdquo;
said the one. &ldquo;You must boil the root of a plant
called merilian, and you must pour the water into
juniper-berry juice, and then you will have a
liquorice that is so sweet and good that it will even
cure a toothache.&rdquo; The young fellow said he would
try it, some time, when he had found the plant.</p>

<p>Toward evening the girls wanted to leave. Yet
that drove him to despair, and he begged them to
stay for a little while. But the girls simply would
not. Their mother would not allow it, said they.
When the young fellow saw that they were really
going, he went quite out of his mind. He had
grown so very fond of the younger <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">huldra</i> maiden,
and now he was never to see her again. Without
knowing what he did, he threw the jew&rsquo;s-harp at her,
and hit her on the head, just as she was passing
through the door. And with that she came in again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, mother! A Christian has won sister
Sireld!&rdquo; cried the other, out in front of the hut.
Soon after a very ancient woman came hobbling and
shuffling into the hut. Her face was so wrinkled and
dark that her yellow teeth shone out from it, for
teeth she had, in spite of her age. &ldquo;Now you may
keep her, since you have won her, for now she is
no longer bewitched,&rdquo; said the old woman to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
young fellow. &ldquo;And if you are kind to her, you shall
never lack food or clothing, and you shall have all
that you need, both Sundays and workdays. But if
you treat her unkindly, you shall pay for it!&rdquo; said
the old woman, and raised her cane as though she
were about to use it on the young fellow. Then she
hobbled out again.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he had won a wife very
quickly, after all, in this manner, and he asked her
how it all came to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jew&rsquo;s-harp struck my head with such force,
that a drop of blood flowed,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and it
was the best thing you could have done, for I would
much rather live with Christians than with the underground
folk,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>He still thought the world and all of her, and yet
it seemed to him as though he could have done nothing
worse: all had happened so quickly, and he had
nothing on which to marry; but after all, what was
done was done. The following morning she went
home with him. His family were much surprised to
see him come back in such company, and were angry
with him, and looked for excuses to find fault with
the girl: but there was nothing to object to about
her, except that she had yellow teeth, and after all,
this was no such great matter. In her dealings with
others she was uncommonly amiable, and there was
not a girl that went to church who could equal her
in beauty.</p>

<p>But after the wedding he gradually began to ill-treat
her. For you must know that he could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
forget she was not a Christian. He sulked, and
was always angry and ill-natured, and never gave
her a kind word. And he refused to grant her least
request. Though it might be the merest trifle, he
never had more than a short &ldquo;No&rdquo; for anything she
asked. And in spite of this she was kind and
friendly, and acted as though she did not hear his
angry words, and was always helpful and amiable.
But it made no difference, he grew worse from day
to day. And they began to go downhill, for strife
in the home drives luck away. At last it seemed
as though they would have to take the beggar&rsquo;s bowl
and staff, and wander from one farm-stead to another
like any other beggars.</p>

<p>One day she did not know what to give the people
to eat, for there was not even a crust of bread in
the house. And then she grew sad, for all might
have been different for them had he but treated her
better. He was standing in the smithy at the moment,
about to shoe a horse, and she went out to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you build me the pen now, the one I have
so often, often asked you for?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Do
it now, and I will shoe the horse!&rdquo; And she tore
the red-hot horse-shoe from the anvil, and bent it
in shape with her bare hands. When he saw that
she was mistress of such arts, he grew frightened,
and actually built her a fine, big pen back of the
stable, set in a post, and drove a hook into it, just
as she had said. The following morning the pen
filled with fire-red cattle, big, fat, handsome beasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that gave a great deal of milk. Such fine cows had
never been seen anywhere. And on the hook hung
a copper milk-pail, and a pair of horns of salt, with
a silver ring from which to hang them. And now
it was not long, as you may imagine, before they
were more than prosperous at the farm-stead again.</p>

<p>For a time everything went well. He let her work
and command in the house, and she had unfailing
luck in all she undertook, so that wealth flowed in to
them from every side. But at length he once more
began to ill-treat her. Wherever he went he remembered
that she was no Christian, no matter how
kind, and amiable and obedient she might be, and
just like any one else, save that she was far, far
handsomer. Once he reached down the poker from
the wall, and was about to beat her. She jumped up
and begged him insistently not to touch her: &ldquo;For
else both of us will be unhappy!&rdquo; But he would
not listen to her, and beat her about the head, until
the blood ran over the poker and fell on his hand.
And then she suddenly disappeared from his sight.
It seemed as though she had floated through the wall,
or sunk into the ground. He saw nothing, but he
heard a woman sob and weep, very quietly and
softly, and painfully, and with a deadly sadness.
After a little while all was silent&mdash;and then he heard
no more. He searched day in, day out, here and
there, hither and yon, and his neighbors, too, went
along and helped him search; but to no avail, for
he did not find her, and could not even discover a
trace of her. When he was in the hill pastures during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the summer, and the rest of the folk were up
there as well, and even after they had gone, he
would sit night after night, and play &ldquo;The Blue
Melody&rdquo;; yet he never saw her again, nor any of
her folk.</p>

<p>In the summer his little girl was old enough to
begin going to school. And one day she said to her
father, when he came up to the hills: &ldquo;I am to bring
you a kind greeting from mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, my little girl, is that really the truth?
Where did you speak to her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She and two others came here the day that Guro
fetched the sheep, and since then she often comes
here,&rdquo; answered the little one, &ldquo;and they gave me
their clasps, too,&rdquo; said she, and showed him three
handsome round clasps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she come back home to us?&rdquo; he asked, as
well you may imagine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said that she really could not do that, and
that she had to protect you continually against folk
who wanted to harm you!&rdquo; said the little one.</p>

<p>Sadness had been his portion before this, and now
it did not grow any less. And it was a blessing that
before many years had passed the earth closed over
him.</p>

<p class="center">NOTE</p>

<p>Touching in its simplicity, and characteristically local is this final
fairy-tale of &ldquo;The Player on the Jew&rsquo;s-Harp&rdquo; (Bergh, p.&nbsp;38). In
its cheerful beginning, and toward its sad close sounds the magic
music of &ldquo;The Blue Melody,&rdquo; which some one caught from the underground
folk in ancient times. From primal days folk-lore has glorified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
the irresistible power of music as magic of supernatural origin.
Horand in the &ldquo;Hegeling Saga&rdquo; is credited with having learned this
melody on the wild wave, from a water-spirit; and the legend that
his compelling art was a gift of the underground folk was even
current of the Norwegian fiddler Ole Bull (1880).</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
